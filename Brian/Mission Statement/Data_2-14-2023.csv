We believe that these educational goals are best served by demanding of our students active participation in the planning of their own programs  and in the regulation of their own lives on campus. Student freedom is not the absence of restraint  however; it is rather the fullest possible substitution of habits of self-restraint for restraint imposed by others. The exercise of student freedom is the very condition of a meaningful education  and an essential aspect of the nurture of free citizens  dedicated to civilized values and capable of creative and constructive membership in modern society.,,

Young men  born and raised in all parts of the United States and Canada  South and Central America  Europe  Africa and Israel  arrive on campus with various backgrounds  but with a common desire to attain a high level of Talmudic Scholarship  as well as the inherent ability to cope with a demanding program of studies.  In the years that these people will spend at the College  it is expected that they will develop habits of scholarship  techniques of independent research  and most essential  a love of learning which will stand them in good stead throughout their lives.  There is another objective that has always been part of the Telshe Yeshiva; a graduate must possess those qualities of character and mind which mark him as being a concerned  involved member of the Jewish community  and a productive member of society as a whole. Leadership in community affairs  education and in civic matters has always been the hallmark of the Telshe graduate - in addition to the world - renowned scholarship of so many of its former students.,,
