Bennington College,Bennington regards education as a sensual and ethical  no less than an intellectual  process. It seeks to liberate and nurture the individuality  the creative intelligence  and the ethical and aesthetic sensibility of its students  to the end that their richly varied natural endowments will be directed toward self-fulfillment and toward constructive social purposes. We believe that these educational goals are best served by demanding of our students active participation in the planning of their own programs  and in the regulation of their own lives on campus. Student freedom is not the absence of restraint  however; it is rather the fullest possible substitution of habits of self-restraint for restraint imposed by others. The exercise of student freedom is the very condition of a meaningful education  and an essential aspect of the nurture of free citizens  dedicated to civilized values and capable of creative and constructive membership in modern society.

Bowdoin College,Two guiding ideas suffuse Bowdoin’s mission. The first from the College of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries defines education in terms of a social vision. “Literary institutions are founded and endowed for the common good and not for the private advantage of those who resort to them . . . but that their mental powers may be cultivated and improved for the benefit of society” (President Joseph McKeen’s inaugural address 1802); “To lose yourself in generous enthusiasms and cooperate with others for common ends . . . ; this is the offer of the College” (President William DeWitt Hyde 1903). The second idea stresses the formation of a complete individual for a world in flux: there is an intrinsic value in a liberal arts education of breadth and depth beyond the acquisition of specific knowledge that will enable a thinking person “to be at home in all lands and all ages” (President Hyde).

Montreat College,
Montserrat College of Art,Montserrat was born in the late sixties a time when people were questioning the status quo and seeking new solutions. A group of artists who were working and teaching in the Boston area had a bold idea: to create a new kind of art school in Massachusetts for professional education in the visual arts – a school that would not only focus on the arts but would also focus on the individual needs of each student. A simple idea but one that had seldom been attempted and rarely achieved. Foregoing the security – but also the limitations – that traditional institutions offered these artists labored to breathe life into their idea.

William Woods University,Highlights from the history of William Woods UniversityOur educational mission began more than 140 years ago in the aftermath of the Civil War in the year 1870. The Christian Church of Missouri as a work of compassion founded a school for girls who had been orphaned by the conflict. The Female Orphan School of the Christian Church of Missouri as it was called eventually moved to Fulton our present home and grew to include other young women in addition to war orphans.Finances were always a challenge for this labor of love. In 1900 the school was saved from insolvency by a successful Missouri entrepreneur named Dr. William Stone Woods. Together with his wife Dr. Woods wrote a check that redeemed the school’s entire debt. In gratitude the University has borne his name ever since.Deeply held valuesWe became a college officially in 1914. Our focus for the next fifty years was on training teachers a profession built on compassion and the personal commitment to help others grow — values that we have held onto since the beginning. You can still see these values stronger than ever at work among our faculty and students today. Our Education graduates continue to be outstanding teachers and leaders in the Missouri school system and beyond.As we grew we broadened our focus to encompass more of the liberal arts and other elements of higher education. Highlights along the way include the growth of an internationally recognized equestrian program which offered the nation’s first baccalaureate in equestrian science in 1972. We entered intercollegiate sports in 1974 with teams in basketball softball track tennis and swimming.From College to University1990 marked a significant milestone: the election of our first female president Dr. Jahnae H. Barnett. Dr. Barnett’s charter was to secure a 21st-century future for William Woods.Within two years we began offering a wide variety of graduate-level degree programs geared toward the working adult. We went coed. And we changed the name from William Woods College to William Woods University. With generous support from alumni foundations and other benefactors our campus our programs and our student body began to look like the William Woods University you see today.Today our undergraduates and graduates study on campus off-campus and online. We have earned dozens of athletic titles. We have instituted fraternities to complement our sororities. We’ve expanded our campus and facilities to meet modern learning needs for technology science the arts sports and student life. We’ve added an overseas study program called “Woods Around the World” as well as international service opportunities to further our mission of broadening the minds of our students beyond classroom learning. Our innovative LEAD grant program begun in 2000 brings the philosophy of extracurricular learning home encouraging students to reach beyond their comfort zones and experience cultural intellectual and other events they wouldn’t otherwise encounter.The best of the past guides our futureAbove all every person at William Woods University remains committed to engage personally by name with each and every one of our students meeting their needs for learning and more as much as our resources will allow.Because we are as always committed to seeing them thrive well into the future.
