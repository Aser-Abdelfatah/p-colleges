In and through the visible world in which we live we come to know and experience the invisible God. In mediation the Catholic vision perceives God not only present in but working through persons events and material things. There is an intelligibility and a coherence to all reality discoverable through spirit mind and imagination. Gods grace prompts human activity to assist the world in creating justice grounded in love. Gods way to us comes as communion through the communities in which men and women live. This community includes the many theological traditions liturgies and spiritualities that fashion the life of the Church. The emphasis on community in Catholicism explains why Notre Dame historically has fostered familial bonds in its institutional life.

William Woods University,Highlights from the history of William Woods University Our educational mission began more than 140 years ago in the aftermath of the Civil War in the year 1870. The Christian Church of Missouri as a work of compassion founded a school for girls who had been orphaned by the conflict. The Female Orphan School of the Christian Church of Missouri as it was called eventually moved to Fulton our present home and grew to include other young women in addition to war orphans. Finances were always a challenge for this labor of love. In 1900 the school was saved from insolvency by a successful Missouri entrepreneur named Dr. William Stone Woods. Together with his wife Dr. Woods wrote a check that redeemed the schools entire debt. In gratitude the University has borne his name ever since. Deeply held values We became a college officially in 1914. Our focus for the next fifty years was on training teachers a profession built on compassion and the personal commitment to help others grow — values that we have held onto since the beginning. You can still see these values stronger than ever at work among our faculty and students today. Our Education graduates continue to be outstanding teachers and leaders in the Missouri school system and beyond. As we grew we broadened our focus to encompass more of the liberal arts and other elements of higher education. Highlights along the way include the growth of an internationally recognized equestrian program which offered the nations first baccalaureate in equestrian science in 1972. We entered intercollegiate sports in 1974 with teams in basketball softball track tennis and swimming. From College to University 1990 marked a significant milestone: the election of our first female president Dr. Jahnae H. Barnett. Dr. Barnetts charter was to secure a 21st-century future for William Woods. Within two years we began offering a wide variety of graduate-level degree programs geared toward the working adult. We went coed. And we changed the name from William Woods College to William Woods University. With generous support from alumni foundations and other benefactors our campus our programs and our student body began to look like the William Woods University you see today. Today our undergraduates and graduates study on campus off-campus and online. We have earned dozens of athletic titles. We have instituted fraternities to complement our sororities. Weve expanded our campus and facilities to meet modern learning needs for technology science the arts sports and student life. Weve added an overseas study program called “Woods Around the World” as well as international service opportunities to further our mission of broadening the minds of our students beyond classroom learning. Our innovative LEAD grant program begun in 2000 brings the philosophy of extracurricular learning home encouraging students to reach beyond their comfort zones and experience cultural intellectual and other events they wouldnt otherwise encounter. The best of the past guides our future Above all every person at William Woods University remains committed to engage personally by name with each and every one of our students meeting their needs for learning and more as much as our resources will allow. Because we are as always committed to seeing them thrive well into the future.
