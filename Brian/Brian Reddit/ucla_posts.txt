GYM BUD? GRAD GYM (KINROSS)
Hey what‚Äôs up? I‚Äôm 29 looking for a committed gym buddy to join me at the Kinross gym . I‚Äôve decided to get back into the gym and want to do some weight training, but very lost where to start so I‚Äôm looking for someone who is kind of versed willing to show me a little bit of what they know about weight lifting, machines and etc; also able to come to the gym when they first open in the morning. We can grab coffee and chat.  I‚Äôm pretty much looking for an accountabilibuddy (some of you are too young to know where that‚Äôs from. Lol.)

grad housing
hi! I‚Äôm going to ucla in early aug for my master‚Äôs &amp; was just wondering how difficult it is to get on-campus housing? specifically the single grad housing in UAN since I won‚Äôt be bringing my car w/ me so I‚Äôm hoping I can get that over the UAS.

Infatuation
Man, I don‚Äôt why I began more and more infatuated these days like when I was in high school I could give less shit about these. Now with moving into college and going through classes and talking with all these fine young bitches I began becoming more lustful each day. Stressballing with my classes. This place is a fuking nerd nuthouse. Full of pretentious phony snobs kissing each other's ass yet deep in their hearts they all fuking fuking each other. Can't everyone just go ease on one another and be nice? I know this is LA Like the fuking movie American psycho. It is so fuking distracting. I want to find a fuking girlfriend and get out of this place. Every day I walk down to campus and take a 2-hour breath class full of 200 people and leave. This fuking sucks and it was fuking boring, and I gotta continue to do this for four years. I am done with this place. I am fuking done with my depressing introverted personality in going through this college, I gonna take to some girls and start a real life. College sucks. Drop out and start a business if you can.

Hi there, I have a project that I'm struggling with, and I'm hoping for some help. It is a whole presentation, but I need specific help with my flow chart.

Looking for female roommate 2023-24 + subletters summer 2023
Hello everyone! Our third roommate in our 1B1Ba is graduating, so we are looking for someone to fill her spot from September 2023 to September 2024 (earlier or just summer lease can be discussed). This is a fully furnished spot in an apartment that is a ten minute walk from De Neve (fifteen minutes to Medical Plaza). One of these beds/desks could be yours! We are looking for a non-smoking/vaping female.  The total rent is $2045/month, so split three ways it comes down to a very affordable $681.33/month. Utilities have generally run us about $25/month/person, with internet being another $20/month/person. Thus, prior to groceries and other living costs, you'd be expecting to pay around $725/month. And with little starting cost, too, since everything is already ready for your move-in!  A little about us: My roomate 21F and I am a 23F. We are both East Asian-American, and LGBTQ-friendly. My roomate is a UCLA alum who is currently working in Santa Monica, and my hobbies are playing viddy games and writing fiction. I am a grad student in scenic design, and I like watching live shows and movies and exploring LA architecture! We tend to live a pretty quiet life, with guests over infrequently. Our favorite way to bond is through making food for each other! Currently, the three of us split our grocery bills ($25/week/person) and roughly split our cooking/cleaning duties based on our schedules and mood. We‚Äôre looking for someone who‚Äôs equally excited to continue this tradition.  The lease starts and ends September 1st, but if you would like to move in during the summer, we do have two spots open. (In general, to those looking for a summer sublease only, contact us and we can help you out!)  Please DM me if you think we would be a good match. Looking forward to meeting you all!  https://preview.redd.it/s123ezp6q7la1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d916bda3a6b11750306ef3e96141d0cdc2ebf520  https://preview.redd.it/nsoblyp6q7la1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2e49e42589bda8ea9851e788397aa0d91be06ac3  https://preview.redd.it/gdhf33p6q7la1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f839bf00ff44613e5c947c88fc9c1b9c938cf34b  *Processing img uj8ei2p6q7la1...*  https://preview.redd.it/y3ns54p6q7la1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=645f1cab7630373ea33dcbf6f28dd702d941dda3  https://preview.redd.it/ehxt4mp6q7la1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1b79d26920b8823c78c2d102121940407c71fc02  https://preview.redd.it/upupimp6q7la1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8620a490ad03c34c130310a96795063e5cc5a1ee  https://preview.redd.it/crr9p2p6q7la1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0b3b9a91d676a71e3c77733e573c1b4c630ccaa6  https://preview.redd.it/fvruupo6q7la1.jpg?width=1108&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=565996b0bffb3b022a46c9d53c5abb083e23dca7  https://preview.redd.it/z17xnbp6q7la1.jpg?width=1108&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ea8eddde8a4bc9b826de1bfc4b998f4a03ffb650

What would be a sufficient reason for receiving a pass or no pass in a petition? PLEASE HELP
So I am an English major Pre-law student, and for some reason I decided to take an Introductory STEM course(just for fun). Yes, I know stupid mistake. Anyway, I have a C in this class at the moment, and am afraid it will affect my GPA in order to get into a good law school. Since its an intro class I want to petition for a pass or no pass because it's already Week 8, but can't find any excuse in why it would be plausible because of the impossible limitations UCLA has: **poor or superior academic performance, poor judgment in choosing classes, change of major, or illness. What else would be a sufficient passing reason? Someone please help.**

Hedrick Hall Dorm Scam?
...now looking back, it's so stupid i got swindled into doing this shit but at the time, my mind wasn't in the right state and i felt pressured. did anyone else get approached by some high school dudes asking to help support their business school project by buying an LA Times newspaper subscription? it happened to me on south 4th floor of hedrick hall (but i saw them visiting other floors too) last week on feb 22nd. i didn't want to give my credit card info but they said i'd get reimbursed later... sounds so stupid but in the moment i didn't know how to say no still and they seemed legit since i got their email address and phone number. it was a dumb mistake and after seeing the part where i had to input my personal info, i should've stopped there.  my bank acct first labeled my payment as pending but now the $25 i paid went through. i went to my LA times acct and canceled the subscription to stop anymore possible payments.

A word of caution to would-be Bruins
With the Spring fast approaching, it is time again for letters from universities to applicants. Students from all over will receive acceptances, waitlists, or rejections. Many of them will come from our own UCLA, which received some 175,000 applications last year. Most students have their preferences in mind, but some will simply make a decision once the acceptances are in. Even fewer will come to those institutions‚Äô subreddits, curious about the schools and with questions for its students, alumni, or staff. In the past, mods have stickied megathreads for the incoming. It is to those few I post this note.   With a handful of exceptions, I do *not* recommend you go to UCLA. Those exceptions include: you are certain you are going into a STEM field (finance included), you are an athlete or person of color, and/or you are a citizen of California (receiving in-state tuition). These are broad categorizations but make sense to me and other alumni. College is expensive and a large number of folks only go for the credential. If I had to redo things, I likely would not have gone to UCLA, Cal, or possibly any school (off the bat). The bad outweighed the good, and I am arguably a worse person now than before stepping on campus as an undergrad.  Regardless of your ultimate decision, good luck.

sculpture garden smut - NSFW
i recently discovered that i'm pretty good at writing smut, so i tried my hand at writing one based on our beautiful campus! only 500 words, let me know what you think and i hope you horny bastards enjoy :)      &gt; ‚Äúi love seeing you worried.‚Äù i looked back at him, as he looked up at me. he reached up and grabbed my hand. ‚Äúno one‚Äôs going to know. this spot is just for you and me.‚Äù   &gt;  but people were going to know. for god‚Äôs sake, we were practically in the middle of the damn sculpture garden. even though it was getting close to nightfall all it would take is someone on a short walk and we would be found. and he knew that! he was toying with me just because he could, because he knew i would do whatever he said.  &gt; as he pulled me down, i let my balance go as i fell into his arms. i kissed him like i‚Äôd kissed him many times, softly at first, then with more and more purpose, pushing myself into him, drinking from him. he let out a soft moan, like he ALWAYS did, cause he knew it would drive me crazy. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to blow our cover, you idiot.‚Äù he smiled at me. ‚Äúi‚Äôm not going to be the one blowing something right now.‚Äù  &gt; he was so confident it was almost annoying. but as i felt the heartbeat emanate from his pants i knew he was right. as i unzipped his pants i thought about the first time i‚Äôd seen it, and how i‚Äôd gasped like it was my first time seeing a dick. i was one of those people who always said they didn‚Äôt care about dick size, and that was still true, but his dick was different. it was big in a way that it almost posed a challenge, like it wanted me to stretch my sexual horizons almost as much as it would stretch me.  &gt; i blew him for at least ten minutes, and in that time no one walked by, not even one! but the instant i wanted to ride him of course some lost freshman walked by. why they have 6pm classes in bunche i‚Äôll never know. that doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt fuck me, of course; once we were at that stage we always fucked. it was impossible not to! once i was that turned on his dick fit perfectly inside me, like it was finally home. but it meant that i had to stifle my moans under the blanket. the whole. fucking. time. he relies on my self control, honestly. i think next time we fuck at his place i‚Äôll be extra loud just to get him back.  &gt; that was the first time that i ever had sex in public, but it wasn‚Äôt the last. the sculpture garden is nice, but there are a few other places that were even riskier, and therefore better for us (the best one being in the main library of Powell). we fed off of that, the idea of being seen, both because of the obvious taboo and because it would in a way validate just how perfect things felt. we were as landmarks, as natural and everyday as the buildings and streets of that campus, and i fit with him.

Would it be plausible to take cs33, cs35L, phys 1B, phys 4AL in one quarter? Or would it be too much to handle? If so, would a better idea be to take cs35L out of the schedule and take a GE?  Any advice is much appreciated. Thanks :)

My Review of HC70A with Professor Goldberg
I cannot talk with friends today  Because I have more reading  I have no time to laugh or play  Because I have more reading  I‚Äôd love to spend time at buffets  Have fun in many other ways  But alas, much to my dismay  I can‚Äôt  Because I have more reading  I can‚Äôt spend time on anything  Because I have more reading  My sanity hangs by a string  Because I have more reading  My memory is now blurring  Forgetting all on page 19  Recounting all the things I‚Äôve seen  Is hopeless  Because I have more reading  I stay up past the crack of dawn  Because I have more reading  Many sleepless nights have come and gone  Because I have more reading  I power through my every yawn  But the pages just go on and on  It‚Äôs a lonely life that I must don  Because I have more reading  Now discussion brings me stress  Because I have more reading  I read for lecture, but nonetheless  I somehow have more reading  I have no time to decompress  What I‚Äôd like to do is‚Ä¶ well I digress  I must get back to Pearson‚Äôs text  Because I have more reading  Discussion asks things I don‚Äôt know  Although I did the reading  I couldn‚Äôt even write down notes  Because I had more reading  So now I have nothing to show  My answers would make you think I‚Äôm slow  Which makes me want to chug Bordeaux  Because I did all the reading  And now discussion‚Äôs finally done  And yet I have more reading  We had one lecture, now another one  And so I do more reading  We‚Äôll watch a movie, which is fun  But our week‚Äôs work has just begun  Which makes me want to use my gun  Because we have more reading  I‚Äôve had the last lecture of the week  So I should have no more reading  But now quiz answers I must seek  And so I do more reading  Some of the questions make me weak,  Confused, and hopeless; things look bleak  It‚Äôs almost due, I want to shriek  But I can‚Äôt find  The answers in the reading  It‚Äôs Monday, just past 6 o‚Äôclock  And now I have more reading  Lecture‚Äôs tomorrow, and I‚Äôm not shocked  That I must do more reading  A cycle that will never stop  I wish my brain would simply pop  And so I go reach for my glock  Because, yet again, I have more reading

Motorcycle Theft in front of Levering Terrace - looking for info
Hi everyone, my motorcycle (white 2017 Kawasaki Z650 pictured above) was stolen between yesterday at 1:53PM and today at 11AM where it was parked in front of Levering Terrace at that little stop sign intersection between Gayley Heights and Chevron. It's probably been scrapped for parts or sent to a new ZIP code by now, but I thought it would still be helpful for my police report to ask if anyone here saw someone taking a white motorcycle from there between the times listed. I know a lot of other motorcyclists park there, so be careful y'all and hold your loved things close üò≠üò≠üò≠

Some advice for a struggling freshman
Hey! I am a CS major freshman and i think i need some advice from some wiser people. So basically when i started my UCLA journey i tried studying the same way as in high school.  My first quarter here (summer) i stressed myself out so much with the grades and work that i did not relax even for a day and only because of that got all A‚Äôs for all 3 classes.  My second quarter i also took 3 classes but i was so burnt out and tired from summer + the TA strike made + i got supper sick for 2 weeks that i did not do well at all. I got an A, a B, and a C üòÖ This quarter I decided to get my game up, spend time on studying and getting better mental health. At the beginning of the quarter i was doing fine but by the second half it became harder and harder to balance it all out. I am afraid i might not get A‚Äôs this time either.   And while as a CS major i don‚Äôt care that much about GPA, I care a lot about actually learning the stuff.   It seems like you guys kind of figured it out. Please dump a bunch of advice on me here: how to balance things, maybe some note taking tips, anything that you learnt from experience.  If you guys have some words of encouragement i would appreciate that too as my self esteem rn is lower than my gardes üòÖ

Looking for a 4th Female to fill our RSU Group (2bd/4person)
Hello, currently looking for one female roommate to join our group! We are aiming for a 2bd/4prsn apartment. We are fine with someone who drinks/smokes, as long as they don‚Äôt smoke in the apartment. We would also like someone who is fairly consistent in cleaning, that is making sure that their dishes don‚Äôt pile up and contributing to the cleanliness of the overall apartment on a consistent basis/to the same extent as everyone else. Our early RSU signup is March 6th at 10:45 AM. Let us know if you are interested.

I can‚Äôt get over rejection
 I am a junior right now, and I still can‚Äôt over it. I rushed like 15 different chapters in my freshman, sophomore, and junior year, and I never gotten a single bid. People tell me it is no big deal if you can‚Äôt make it into a frat, and then turn around and talk about how Greek life was great for making friends and developing connections.   It also hurts when people say joining a frat is easy or whatever at this school, yet clearly that wasn‚Äôt the case for me when I got rejected by 15 different chapters. It makes me feel worthless and as if there is something wrong with me

How do I survive my lame duck or fourth year?
I am a third year now and did nothing in the past three years. I got rejected from all clubs and opportunities I tried to applied to. The sad thing is that I will be a lame duck next year, so I am powerless to fix my life. No club or frat will take me. It is too late to get research experience. Most fourth year friend groups are lock and closed. It is too late to get internships. I can‚Äôt go to grad school. I can‚Äôt do anything besides sitting and watch everyone else have a good life   It is over. It just hurts because UCLA could have been a life changing opportunity for me, but it wasn‚Äôt

Advice for Language Requirement
I'm running out of time to do the 3rd level of a language for a language requirement. My current plan is to go to a community college and try to place into level 3 Spanish, Chinese, or French, but if that doesn't work out due to issues like requirement to complete last 40-something units at UCLA, what could I take at UCLA that is easy (and preferably fast)? I have already tried and dropped a Korean language class because I was terribly slow at recognizing the alphabet and when I learned that Korean 3 would be far harder.

How can I find UCLA students in need of tutoring, editing, and writing services? I no longer live in LA but am available remotely. It was something I did for and enjoyed for years in helping other undergrads when I was one too. Any tips on where to find students nowadays to advertise my services?
Hey all, grew up in LA, miss the sunshine a lot where I am living now as a grad student in Europe. I still do this work here and there via Zoom as I now have 5+ years experience helping students sharpen up their writing, analytical, and communication skills while they are taking various courses in the social sciences, humanities, etc. (I do not tutor for math or physical sciences, but mostly have helped with everything else). I used to find my clients via [Care.com](https://Care.com) as parents would list there, but it makes more sense to reach out to the groups directly. So where would it be best to let students know this online? I'm also not really active on social media either, so I was thinking here, FB groups, but what else?  I also enjoyed just reading people's work and offering free editing suggestions whenever I had the time so I could help students along the way.   When I tutored other students it was through word of mouth and people sharing my information around. **Any leads you guys, please? Feel free to message me as well if I may be of help. I've had some new life expenses come up with a recent move, so it's time to get back to work for me.**   Also, if you're reading this, I'd be happy to help anyone in need of it with a look-over for some free editing suggestions or insights if you're struggling with something written right now but are not looking for paid services.   I know it's the age of GPT-3, but we have not been taken over by the robot overlords yet - that's because what it cannot do right now (still) is produce the cohesive, clear, and concise points necessary for substantive academic work on par to top scoring human produced work that gets the As/top grades. Just as importantly than that, I want to work with students 1on1 to help them with their personal and professional goals as they develop their pathways.

Premed Major
Right now I‚Äôm pre-HBS, and I was wondering if it‚Äôd be better to just switch to something like MCDB or Cog Sci? The reasoning being: I‚Äôve gotten 50 ppl asking what Human Biology and Society even is, and that means adcoms won‚Äôt exactly know either. I chose it because the description sounded so interesting but the title of the major itself is just not revealing. Plus it has so many prereq classes, and I feel like at this point it might be better to just choose something that explicitly says better what it‚Äôs about. I know it‚Äôs not a big difference in med school admissions, I‚Äôm also just tired of having to explain.

Looking for a Roommate (F) For Early RSU- De Neve Plaza Double
Please hmu if interested!

Which is best- Glenrock, Glenrock West, or Westwood Palm?
I am deciding between these 3 buildings but I not sure which one to decide. I have made a pros and cons list for each building:   Glenrock:  Pros- newer, nicer looking, probably doesn‚Äôt smell as bad as the older buildings.  Cons- no A/C (but this isn‚Äôt a huge issue for me since I tend to run cold anyways. If I get too hot, I can just take a cold shower). Also do the apartments at Glenrock have garbage disposals? If not, this would be a con.   Glenrock West:   Pros- has A/C.  Cons- older building so there‚Äôs the issues that come with that (like smells, things functioning slowly). Also glenrock and glenrock West are on a hill so that would be a rough walk, but I could get used to it.   Westwood Palm:  Pros: Closest to campus, has A/C.  Cons: I heard about some mold there, which is concerning. But I‚Äôve seen mold at Gayley Court (where I currently live) and I‚Äôve been fine. It‚Äôs also a very old building so I am concerned about the functionality of it. But GC is also old and I‚Äôm fine there.    Also, what is the noise level like at each of these apartments late at night? What time does the noise die down on the weekends? Noise is an extremely important factor for me because I am a very light sleeper.

To everyone who‚Äôs had a shitty quarter
It‚Äôs me. I did it. Im the one who made your quarter shitty. I did all of it. I told your roommate to fart in their sleep so you would stay up, I told them to leave their stanky laundry out and throw their trash on the ground. I paid the professors to make your and only your midterm extra hard. I made bruinwalk a little slippery just so you could fall when it got wet. I spat in your sandwich from the study. All of those electric scooters on the sidewalk?  All me. I put every single one there so you would have to step over them. I punched the ucla servers so the internet would go down. I added an extra step so you would be a little more tired when you walked up the steps around campus. Why did I do it? Because it was funny. Look at you. You‚Äôre a little funny, dirty child. Dumbass. Get shat on. Get swindled. Dumbfounded lookin ass.

I fucking hate my roommate
I hate this fucking dude. This fucker has zero self-awareness about the shit he does in this dorm. I'm in a triple and my other roommate also fucking hates this dude. This mf is always muttering about some dumb shit for his fantasy novel (which is so goddman cringe and cliche), is always in the fucking room cuz he has no social life, and is constantly playing games so its such a fucking distraction. Every time man I gotta tell this dude to knock it off and just be quiet, but this mf just continues this behavior. We always gotta tell this mf to take out the trash, clean up after himself, and so on. I'm just sick of living under the same roof as him and so is my roommate. We are just not compatible people to live with this fucking guy.   Shit got heated when I actually got our RA involved so this dude would actually just fucking listen, but fuck man I seriously cannot keep living with him. Even after our RA meeting, the dude is the same with the exception he isn't playing fucking games while on voice chat 24/7 anymore. He's quieter sure, but I cannot keep living with this dude and his shit habits. HE DOESN'T EVEN FUCKING WASH HIS HANDS PROPERLY. My roommate and I saw this fucker finishing taking a shit and NOT WASH HIS HANDS. Now this dude washes his hand WITHOUT  soap for 3 seconds ever since we called him out on that. I cannot man. I actually want to kick this dude out or move somewhere else with my other roommate.   BY THE WAY. When I actually did try to be diplomatic about our issues with each other, this mf tried guilt tripping me and telling me he's a fucking loner and how he finds it hard to integrate into me and my roommate's friend groups. Like bitch??? You're not entitled to that shit fuck off and I don't have any responsibility to help you go touch some fucking grass. He did it to himself by refusing to come with us to shit (when we were just getting to know each other), go to the floor events, or just anything involving talking to a human being. AND HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL ME MY ROOMMATE AND I WE NEVER TRIED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS HOBBIES. Like bitch we literally TRIED to know you better, and you're the one who's shutting yourself from us, not the other way around.  I'm literally roommates with a NEET, God help me.

Admission cuts
Was anyone really surprised that they reduced admission for grad school? Like most of us TAs got a 500$ raise. Thats alot of money across all departments and thats just TAs GSRs and Post docs got a big raise too. This will cause less people to be hired. I mean this sucks cause my girlfriend was just denied admission for chem phd here but this reduction of admission was expected. Did nobody really see this coming?

What should I do?
Hey guys I got the last seat in one of my classes but the section is on a Friday, and I need a Tues/Thursday section. What should I do? Should I just wait until the quarter starts and ask the professor if I can switch sections?

Chances of getting a double as a current freshman with no RSU group?
unfortunately waited too late to really try and find people to room with, all my friends are rooming in sorority housing or are already in a group and the few people i reached out to on social media postings went with other options. at this point i‚Äôd rather choose my own room and have a random roommate rather than join some random person‚Äôs group since it at least worked out for me as a freshman. however i really want to be in a double again and idk if that‚Äôs possible with my main sign up time (march 9th 3:30 pm). does anyone who‚Äôs gone through the process before without creating a group before think there‚Äôd be at least a few openings for doubles at that point? or is this where i should start e-begging for anyone to join an RSU group? üò≠

For the people who‚Äôve had either of these profs in the past which one do you think would be more accommodating ?

Don't join this "Hack with a Pro" Hackathon advertisement - It's tied to a religious group with decades of abuse.
They're offering a free hackathon at one of their houses but they're just using it to get your numbers and a way to connect so they can try to get you to join their group. They'll teach you to code but they'll quickly transition to preaching about the importance of community in college and how their church offers a great community, it's manipulation, and false promises.  If you want to know more about the group look up r/GracepointChurch/  https://preview.redd.it/71ilucri8lka1.png?width=473&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ef8ade3d5ea5703003a0a910506aa957d5a45b00

Summer Sessions: Housing Question
I'm a 15 year old from the UK hoping to take two courses (Digital Cinematography and Film and TV directing, 8 units in total) with UCLA Summer Sessions this year. Obviously, as a minor travelling abroad, I'd have to stay with the University. It's pretty clear about the fees I'd pay for the course but then this bullet point on the "Fee Calculator" confused me:     * **Housing fees are included** in the program fee for ***mandatory*** ***housing programs.***  &amp;#x200B;  What is a mandatory housing program? How do I know if I'm applying to a mandatory housing program?

Math 170E with Jeong, H. or Odhiambo, C.O.
Hey guys, any suggestions on who I should take Math 170E with?

contemplating a transfer and would appreciate some support ‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôve never been so depressed in my life. Before coming to UCLA, I never struggled with depression and anxiety. I am really lucky to be doing well here, it‚Äôs not necessarily a rigor concern. I don‚Äôt know what to do and on the rare chance I decide to share this, I sometimes feel invalidated that I should be having the time of my life here. I am contemplating transferring to a different 4-year university. I was wondering if someone could offer me advice or if you have successfully transferred to PM me. I‚Äôm really sorry for posting this and I feel awful. I don‚Äôt really have a support system here :(

I keep getting unlucky this quarter. Need emotional support‚ù§Ô∏è
I havn't experienced anything worse in my life than the past two months. I started the quarter with a good spirit, but then I got into an argument with my roommate and he is barely around anymore. I learned from my mistakes and tried to be even better, but I just was lonely and depressed since I don't have many friends here. Just when I was making new friends, devoting into clubs and academics, I had trouble with my finances and cars right before the midterm, causing me to barely get a B in a class I spent almost 20 hours on every week. I picked up good study habits, started to exercise more but this shitty weather and my weak immune system got me sick at home for the last 2 days. I have nothing lined up for summer and I am absolutely messed up for that as well even though I was putting over 15 hours prepping every week. Man, I am feeling super frustrated right now. I don't know how much more I can hang on to this endless cycle of improving from misfortunes and misfortune shortly after.

Roommate Group for UA
Hi, we‚Äôre a group of 3 girls looking for other roommates. We are hoping for a 2bd 6person room in Gayley Heights on one of the upper floors. We keep our shared spaces pretty clean and are also not really drinkers or smokers (only one of us drinks and smokes occasionally). We‚Äôre not opposed to bringing guests over, maybe a quick heads up for male guests tho (one of us is Muslim). LGBTQ friendly. Overall, we‚Äôd just appreciate people who are similar to us and are relatively clean. If you‚Äôre interested or have any questions feel free to message us!

It keeps getting worse. I hate it here man...
As a follow up to my last post [https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/11amr2h/they\_finally\_removed\_the\_sausage\_sandwiches\_and/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/11amr2h/they_finally_removed_the_sausage_sandwiches_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), where I pointed out that the Study removed the sausage sandwiches and fries from the kiosk, it seems that the almighty god Charles was not happy with my keen observation which exposed his cruel penny-pinching tactics and chose to further smite me and other Study enjoyers by changing the pepperoni on the pizzas.    For the past week they had introduced those awesome, restaurant-quality, smaller slices of pepperoni which would curl and crisp up in the oven, but to my dismay, in my pizza today I found that they reverted to using the large slices of pepperoni they usually use in the sandwiches.   I feel like this change really brought the pizzas down a notch, on top of the horrendous bread-to-topping ratio and their lackluster melting of the mozzarella cheese in the wood-fired ovens, it's clear that the Study pizzas lack any semblance of good taste. I'm so proud of them for adding artichokes to pizzas this year though so good on them for that!  I used to be proud of my status as a Study enjoyer but I might have to renounce this title if any further deprecation occurs...

AITA for yelling at my roommate?
I (22m) live in a 4 bedroom, 8 person apartment, where there are 7 of us living there. For the most part we keep to ourselves and keep things amicable and try to respect each other‚Äôs space, belongings and privacy. One of my roommates, S (21m) brings his friends over often at night, drinks with them and overall get somewhat loud and obnoxious. But couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore when on Wednesday night/Thursday morning while working on a group project that ended up being 15 pages long S and his friends were being so loud my phone‚Äôs audio picked up their yelling when FaceTiming my group mates. It was 1 AM, and was fed up, I opened my door and yelled ‚ÄúYO! IT‚ÄôS ONE IN THE MORNING! SHUT THE FUCK UP!‚Äù Quickly closed the door and  S and his friends kept quiet, finished their conversation and left. I haven‚Äôt talked to S since, but asked one of my roommates who was up at the time if I was harsh. This roommate said no.   Yesterday while waiting for the elevator a student from one the neighboring units walked over and asked if she heard my roommates being loud on Wednesday night. She said yes and even said S had ding dong ditched her and her roommates in the middle of the night earlier this year.   So Am I the Asshole for yelling at my roommate?

I chose EECS at Berkeley over EE at UCLA
EDIT: üìë I üí∞ did not üèª apply üìÑ to UCLA, and regret it. By ‚Äúchose‚Äù I üòÇ mean ü§î I chose not to apply. üìÑ    And it was the worst üëπ decision I have üà∂üà∂ ever üòâüëç made.

UCB doesn‚Äôt üòö hold a candle, I have üà∂üà∂üà∂ no idea why üöÆüò¢ü§î they üë¨ are often compared. üò°‚úäüîè When ü§∑ I prestige (aka have a kid) üö∏üë¶ I will make sure they know this.

"Free" Summer Housing Options by Working with ResLife?
I couldn't get 5A for the 3rd quarter in a row now and I'm looking to possibly take it this summer.

I literally remember nothing else. Does anyone know if there's any housing opportunities like this or any affordable ones? Or if anyone can share their experiences on this, that'd be great also! Thank you so much :0

avoid 4b8p uni apts &lt;/3
the ones who decided shoving 8 people in an apartment was a good idea should try it out themselvesü´∂üèª   it‚Äôs still a good option if you want affordable housing, or if everything else is taken, or if you have a bigger roommate group.  the upsides to them are that they‚Äôre new, have some nice amenities, and are a bit cheaper, but even then the walls are paper thin (compared to an older uni apt I lived in) and we (and some others) have issues with things in our apt not working.  it‚Äôs just for me, having so many roommates has been nothing but stressful, so if you‚Äôre going with this one, try to make sure you have good roommates that you can get along / be civil with ‚Ä¶ also RA sent an email about seeing increasing numbers in roommate conflicts ü§î wonder why?

Looking for a 2bd 4ppl RSU (female)
Hello! I am looking to form a 2 bd 4ppl RSU in a building with parking.

It‚Äôs especially important to me for the kitchen to be clean.  - I‚Äôm fine with guests but if you‚Äôre bringing someone over and you‚Äôd like me out of the room (if we‚Äôre sharing a room), I‚Äôd like some notice.  Here‚Äôs some info about me:  - I‚Äôm an introvert and I keep to myself. But I‚Äôm cool with my roommates having people over as long as it‚Äôs not too late (past 11pm on weekdays or 12am on weekends).  - I go to bed at midnight and try to get 8-9 hours or sleep. Sometimes it‚Äôs a bit later or earlier depending if it‚Äôs a weekend or if I have an early class. But I am quiet if I‚Äôm going back into the room while my roommate is asleep.  - I don‚Äôt smoke. I do drink occasionally but I don‚Äôt get drunk.  DM me if you‚Äôre interested and/or like to talk more about roommate/living preferences!

Pre-dental Transfer
What (preferably life science) major would be good for a pre-dental tranfer student looking to take upper division science courses such as anatomy, physiology, genetics, histology, etc. I originally wanted to apply as a biology major, but a lot of people say it's mostly plants and animals and you don't really do anything with humans. I've also heard physiological sciences is better, but a lot harder. If I apply as a biology major, would I still have a chance at taking these upper divisions, or should I look at other majors?

Anyone know where you can buy an umbrella on campus?

Can you use the Santa Clarita Commuter Express 797/792 JUST from Century City to Westwood?
Hi guys,  My future roommate will work at UCLA this summer, but my job is in Century City. My ideal place to live is in Century City, as I don't have a car, but we're trying to find a compromis-able location to live in so that commute isn't awful for either of us.  I'm a former UCLA grad as well and I interned in Century City over the summer. This summer, I was really frustrated at how unbelievably long it took to get from campus to Century City on public transport. I've tried changing buses at Santa Monica, Metro Micro and even scooters, but every single one took 30 min or more. I feel this is just not justifiable when my managers expect 10-15 min commutes since I would be living so close to the office. It's also frustrating because it's really only a 10 min drive. I was wondering if any of you know whether you can use the Santa Clarita Commuter Express 797/792 to only commute between these two city's instead of all the way from Santa Clarita. I've noticed that when this bus stops at Century City, it typically doesn't take on any passengers regardless of if you have the correct pass or not. There doesn't seem to be any bus that goes up Beverly Glen or any nearby street either. Thanks!

Lost Phone In Murphy Hall Restroom

Transfer student joining in the spring after missing the last two quarters.
Hello everyone!!  I'm reaching out because I'm a transfer student who's finally able to join in the Spring after experiencing some visa issues that prevented me from starting in the Fall. It was a tough time, but I'm stoked to finally be able to attend UCLA.  Anyway, I'm curious if there are any other students out there who have gone through a similar experience? What was it like for you joining mid-year? Did you find it challenging to make friends and get settled into the school community? How hard is it to get acclimated to the quarter system and the pace of the classes?  I'm also aware that making new friends and getting involved in campus life can be a bit daunting, especially since I'll be joining in the Spring. I'm interested in any suggestions or tips for how to get involved and make friends. What are some of the best ways to connect with others and build a social network on campus?  On the bright side, I'll be living on campus, so I'm hoping that'll make it a bit easier to get involved in activities and meet people. But still, I can't help but feel a little anxious about the whole thing.  Anyways, I'm really looking forward to starting this new chapter in my life and becoming a Bruin! Thanks for reading, and I hope to see some of you around campus soon!

Math 31A standard compared with IB?
I'm a UK system student planning on coming over for the SCIP course. I wanted to find out what the standard of the Math 31A course is, compared with, say, A levels or IB HL AA? I really want to take Math 32A but I won't be able to do Math 31A/31B as co-requisite, so I'm going to have to pick one or the other.   PS. it hurts my soul to omit the "s" in "Maths".

enrollment shitpost
I know everyone complains about enrollment, but every enrollment I get more and more angry. It is insane that kids have to beg people to hold classes for them or offer to pay random sums of money to TRY to get a class. You would think after kids have been so vocal about the issue for so long UCLA would do ANYTHING about it but they couldnt give less of a shit. Looking at enrollment options right now and I have no options lmao. EVERY SINGLE ELECTIVE i could possibly take for my major is already full or the few that aren't have less than 20 spots or insane prereqs that I have not taken. What the fuck is someone supposed to do in this situation? Enroll and pay for bullshit units that won't count towards my major at all? I hate enrollment and this shitty ass situation, that happens every fucking time

Two coding classes during one quarter?
Pre-Cognitive science major here. The only pre-major requirements I have left are my coding classes. I plan on taking PSYCH 20A (MATLAB) and STATS (R Programming), would I be making a good choice or am I making the most dumbest decision in the world by stacking the workload of two coding classes? I've only taken PIC 10A before and I gotta admit that it was the most time-consuming class I've ever taken but was doable nonetheless.  My backplane is to take COMPTNG 16A during Summer Session.  If anyone has taken these courses before, which is easier in your opinion?  Thank you for everyone's input in advance :D  Sincerely,  A Hopeless Bruin

I will also have to take it over the summer, and with overlapping plans I cannot do it at a community college, so I was wondering how relevant it was to the course at all. Worse come worse, it is possible for me to take it over the summer but it will be expensive. Thanks for any help y‚Äôall can give!

Can you test out of French after taking the first class?
I took French 1, thinking that my high school french experience would not be enough to get through UCLA, only to realize the entire beginner french series is kinda just taking up units lol. If I took French 1 already, would I still be able to take the placement exam to go to French 3? I really don't want to go through more quarters of French than I have to especially the classes all meet 3 times a week (which is hard for me as someone who has to work full time). I kinda just want to finish French 3 and get it over with, but not sure if because I didn't take the placement exam initially, they'll try to make me do French 2 anyway.  Alternatively, are there other ways like community college courses that people could recommend?

AITA?

Ugh. Second pass opened this morning and I can't enroll in a comm class or a pub aff class that I would reallyyy like to take. I thought once second pass started all enrollment restrictions were dropped but I guess not for these classes/ departments. Does anyone know when I can enroll? At least for comm I can't find it anywhere, not on the message center, department page, etc

fastest major at ucla
Hi guys I've been and currently am in a tight situation as a 4th year at ucla. So to start off, I am not on track to graduate on time for June 2023 (unfortunate I know), this is because I've retaken multiple pre-requisite stem classes and changed my major 2 times. I am currently a computational biology major (I've taken LS7 series, Chem 14, Physics, some math, stats). My question is regarding what the fastest major at ucla to complete is? Of course, I have enjoyed a multitude of my stem classes. However the reason I majored in stem was due to family pressure but at the point I am currently in life I've learned to do what works best for me. I am a first gen student for context, I just want to be able to graduate with a degree from UCLA and know that I didn't waste 3 years of my life if the severe scenario comes that I must need to drop out. I've also learned along the way that I suffered severe BP and ADHD. Honestly, the past few years have put me at my lowest but also given me a substantial amount of positive experiences. With that said, I enjoy learning all types of topics and did not once despise any of my GE classes. So really guys, I would appreciate any advice or feedback on what would be the fastest way to graduate from here, thanks!

rant about econ/mgmt dept from a math/econ perspective
honestly i the fucking econ/mgmt department at this school is a joke... ive taken all my econ classes without showing up to class once and gotten A's and B's, whats the point in having a department that fucking babies the students as if they are in a high school AP Econ class, its kinda gross imo. In I remember in 102/106/104, my professor was still babying us through taking a partial derivative like... its pretty disgusting imo that UCLA charges over $60,000 for this calling it an "education"...   compared this to the math department, where maybe in the beginning of week 1 they do a little review, but thats it. all the math upper divs ive taken were amazing, 100% of the class i was learning new things. Overall, i guess im just dissatisfied that i ever even took any econ classes, as literally all except for maybe 103, and 106V. Hopefully after taking 147 and/or 149 (if they offer either) in the fall it will change my perspective, but I doubt it.

switching to ling&amp;cs as transfer students (166 units)
I'm a transfer student that really want to switch to ling&amp;cs, I'll be finished with the switching requirements by next quarter but I'll have 166 units in total. (on their website they said they'll usuallyapprove for anyone that has less than 150 units)   Does anyone know if it is still possible for me to switch? anyone has done it before? I've been realizing how much I disliked my current major after I got to the upper divs, but i don't know if i still have a way out...

Chem 14B Midterm 2
How did y‚Äôall do on this midterm compared to the last one? I did pretty bad and I studied quite a bit. I‚Äôm really disappointed because I got 3 questions wrong on the last midterm, and I knew I needed less than 3 questions wrong on this midterm to have any chance at getting an A in the class. I‚Äôm pretty sure I got 3 questions wrong on this midterm, unfortunately. This midterm had quite a few wording issues and I swear that molar entropy question is not something we really discussed in class. I hope Dr. Lavelle curves the test, as these midterms have such a huge impact on our grades.  To be honest, I think Chem 14B this quarter (Winter 2023) is structured horribly. The entire course total is 300 points, and the tests are worth like 220 I believe. On top of that, the midterms are only 15 questions each. So far, 30 questions dictate 70% of our entire grade in the class, which is quite ridiculous, and there is absolutely no room for error. Getting only 4 questions wrong between the two midterms tanks your grade to a B, and getting 6 questions wrong between the two midterms means that it is impossible for you to get an A in the class even if you score 100% on the final. Shouldn‚Äôt we at least have some sort of extra credit opportunities so we can make up points?

NEED psych 100b this quarter or have to drop major
 Hey everyone!¬†  This is my first time really posting here because I am honestly really, REALLY desperate. I have been trying to get psych 100b for 3 quarters now. I got really close this quarter (spot 1 on the waitlist) but was eventually dropped from the class. I went to class for 2 weeks but was dropped after that time because¬†I was not officially enrolled. I got stuck with really shitty enrollment times for winter and spring. For this enrollment period, my 1st pass was on 2/21 at 8:30 am. I was VERY surprised¬†by this because I have junior standing. I reached out to AAP and to the people in charge¬†of enrollment and was basically told there was nothing they could do. As a result, I was unable to enroll in the one class I need to take (psych 100b). I didn't even get the chance to go on the waitlist. The class was completely full yesterday so there is absolutely no way for me to even try to get a spot. I spoke with an academic counselor¬†today and was told that if I don't take the class this upcoming spring quarter, I run the risk of not being able to declare the major.¬†   Some of you might be thinking that I should take it in the summer but the thing about that is that I can't take summer classes. I will be out of the state for the summer and am unable to come to in-person classes for the¬†A6 summer session (the C6 summer session online version of psych 100b¬† is also completely¬†closed). Even if I could stay for the summer, I cannot afford to pay for summer classes and for the housing¬†I would need to stay here over the¬†summer. There is no way for me to afford spring classes+housing, summer classes+housing, AND next year's classes+housing. Because of this, I couldn't even do the in-person psych 100b class if I wanted.¬†   It is very frustrating that I have worked so hard to be in this major and to stay on track but have been unable to take the classes that I need because of enrollment appointments. Because of my financial circumstances, I am unable to do what some of my peers do and pay someone to hold a spot for me. I feel completely¬†powerless and extremely¬†frustrated by this situation. I feel like no one cares or is willing to help. I understand that my struggles are not other people's burden to bear but I can't help but feel so alone in this process.¬†   As a result, I am turning to reddit to see if there are any kind humans out there who would be willing to offer some advice or, even better, willing to give up their spot so that I can stay in the major. I know it is¬† A LOT to ask but I am seriously so desperate¬†and would be endlessly grateful. Truly, being able to take this class in spring quarter would save me a world of heartache and could allow me to continue to finance¬†my education. I am willing to answer any and all questions. I ask that you please approach this post with empathy and I thank you so much for reading through this post.

dining halls are less busy this quarter vs last??
okay so lately i've noticed that this quarter the dining halls are significantly less busy than they were last quarter! like even when it says activity is at 100%, there's still always space left, sometimes even a lot of space. i'm definitely not complaining and i love it, but just wondering if anyone else has noticed this and if anyone knows why?? did they like change the criteria for the activity level or something? but like even if they did do that, i feel like it wouldn't impact the number of people THIS much

What do I do if I fail a class
I just took my chem midterm and after getting a 40 on the last one, I think that I might fail the class. Also, I need at least a C- to take 14C next quarter, so what should I do? I already enrolled in 14C for next quarter and there aren't many other good classes available bc they're all filled up, and I need these classes for my major. I'm also premed, and I got a 3.33 gpa last quarter but I've been doing even worse this quarter so I'm just not sure what to do or if I should even stay on the premed track.

RSU Group Studio Singles??
Hi,  I'm trying to get a Studio Single University apartment, either in Gayley Towers, Glenrock West, or Landfair. Is anyone else(M) trying to get a studio in any of these buildings?

We don't have to share an apartment unit, as long as we are in the same building, we would get access to early RSU.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!

I think a homeless man is stalking me
Hi,  (I'm going to write this assuming he doesn't have reddit, which is a risk I'm willing to take because I've taken the necessary measures to avoid any knowledge he could get from some of the details...)  Here it is. It was Septempter. I had landed at LAX without having planned a ride home, and I refused to waste money on an uber, so I thought to take the bus from LAX to Pacific Palisades, where I was renting a room at the time. I take a random spot on the bus. Across the aisle is a homeless looking man, he has disgusting, mishapen, rotten teeth and bloodshot eyes. He notices my giant suitcase and starts up a conversation. "Oh, are you coming from the airport? Where did you go?" and whatnot. I oblige him. I'm a guy of decent stature and build, it's not like I was afraid him, if he was a creep or whatever. I just thought I'd be nice to this gross-looking man who no one probably talks to. Throughout this hour-long bus ride his questions start to get more personal. "Where do you live?" and eventually, "Can I have your phone number? maybe we could get a coffee or tea sometime." At this point I'm pretty taken aback, but I still don't want to be rude so, like an idiot, I tell him I live in Westwood, which I figure is alright since, at the time, I was in Pacific Palisades. I stop talking to him after this. We finally get to downtown SM, and I get off the bus. So does he. As I'm walking off he calls my name and, with a light and somewhat airy tone, as if he was trying to be seductive, he asks me "Have you ever heard the song, 'It's Only Love?'" I keep walking, and after I'm some distance from him, look back and watch as he shuffles along into a dark corner of downtown.   Fastforward to last week. I live in Westwood now. I'm coming back from class to my apartment going my usual route. And there he is, sitting at a table outside of a coffeeshop. No coffee, of course. We make eye-contact and I kind of do a double-take. Oh shit, it's him. I wonder if he remembers me, was my first thought, then, I wonder what he's doing here. Whatever, I keep walking.   And then yesterday, as I'm walking back from the grocery store I see him standing right next to an apartment entrance that's two buildings from mine. He was in such a weird location that he caught my eye and sure enough he's looking at me, recognizes me. And now I'm very sussed out. I keep walking, and once I'm a little further away I look back. He's shuffled out away from the apartment entrance's little enclosure onto the sidewalk and is looking in my direction. My first thought is that he might be trying to figure out where I live, he must've watched me go after I passed him at the coffeeshop. So I walk passed my building and turn down a nearby street. I wait around for about 15 minutes, and when I go back to my street he's still there, pacing up and down a small section of my block. I wait even longer and approach my building but he's still there and he sees me. Eventually I find a way back to my place but now this shit ways heavy on my mind. This is the first verse of a song by the Beatles, "It's Only Love,"  " I get high when I see you go by, my, oh my   When you sigh, my, my inside just flies, butterflies   Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?  It's only love and that is all   Why should I feel the way I do?   It's only love and that is all   But it's so hard loving you"  Maybe I'm just being paranoid?

Looking for roomate(s)
Hi, I (male) am going to be a senior next year and looking for either:  -a group of 3 to join my 3 to form a 6 person group, We haven‚Äôt picked out at apt yet but we‚Äôre thinking about gaylee heights.  -1 person to be my roommate in a 3/6 -a group of 2 that are looking for a someone to take the single of a 2/3.  Our group has an early RSU on the 6th, mine is in the afternoon on the 6th.   A little about me: I am a a pretty quiet guy and a STEM major, I‚Äôm also involved in a couple of club sports and try to have fun when I can. I tend to stay up pretty late (12-2ish), I enjoy all sports, video games and working out. I drink and smoke, drinking in the apt is fine but my roommates don‚Äôt want any smoking but don‚Äôt care if you do it outside. I don‚Äôt mind having guests over as long as you let me know before hand, ofc I will try to do the same.   Ig I‚Äôm just looking for someone who will be respectful of the space, I am a pretty independent person so I‚Äôll probably be on my own and doing my own thing most of the time. I‚Äôm not a clean freak but I try to be tidy and would like you to be aswell.  If anybody is interested, please shoot me a dm! Obviously what I said above is not set in stone, again I‚Äôm just looking for someone who will be respectful and is open to compromise!

How is Professor Givvin for PSYCH 133F?
I was wondering how her exams are and also what is her participation like. I read reviews about her participation through Clicker but I have never used that before so I have no clue what that is, if someone who had her can explain to me how it works and what it is? Like do I need to participate every time or do I just need to be present in class?

to everyone in chem 14d
The class is hard, the material is hard, everything is hard, and winter quarter isnt making things easier. Take this from someone who also once stumbled my way through this class, it gets better. If you're struggling to understand things or do synthesis or figure out certain reactions, don't bash yourself and don't call yourself names, this shit is tough. Being able to get through it is simply a testament to how strong and smart you really are.  In the wise words of Anish Nag, "this is just one class in your journey of many. Whatever may happen, it doesn't matter. You live and learn and move on to bigger things in your future. Right now, you are a brilliant student overcoming difficult barriers, but you will make it."  Drink water, eat well, sleep the 8, and best of luck to you all on Friday, I (random redditor) believe in all od you!

Math 33b with Wang
I just wanna ask y‚Äôall who have taken her class, is her lectures recorded? I have a class on Fridays that is at the same time so I was thinking just to watch her recorded lecture on Fridays.   Also I have a terrible second pass time so if any of y‚Äôall can hold it for me it‚Äôd be much appreciated!!

Rent is $735 per month can be prorated based on move in date) The only utility you need to pay for is electricity. Gas, water and wifi is included.

If someone is holding a class for me and there is a waitlist, is there a way to guarantee that spot goes to me?
I‚Äôve never done waitlists before, basically, if she drops the class the spot will go to a random person on the waitlist right? Is there a way for the person saving the seat to transfer it directly to me?

Anyone else STRUGGLING in Surro's Econ 102 Class rn or is it just me??
I know I absolutely failed that midterm, but like this Solow Excel Project and final?? sigh sigh.  If the final is anything like the midterm i.e. the questions being nothing like I've ever seen before, boy oh boy idk how I'm gonna pass this class. I wish he would post worked-out solutions to the training set questions bc if I didn't know how to do them the first time around, I simply will not know how to do them when I try to study them again for the tests. Maybe I'm just dumb but I simply am not grasping the intuition behind these concepts. Tips on how to study more effectively for this class would be greatly appreciated. + study buddies?

Should I drop the class or go P/NP?
I just got my midterm grade back for a comms class. 39/45 which is a B. The course gives us a 10/10 as extra credit which brings my total to an 89.09%. I have yet to take the final which is out of 45. I need to score a 44/45 on the final in order to earn an A. I plan on attending law school so this is risky. If I go Pass/No pass this will be my second time using this option of an non major related elective course. Or I could just drop the class (not sure if I‚Äôll get a transcript notation, does it warn you?)   but I‚Äôm also enrolled with the professor for a side project so I don‚Äôt want things to be awkward. Thanks for all your help!  I plan on attending law school after undergrad btw!
