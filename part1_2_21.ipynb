I‚Äôm a grad student who will be visiting UCLA for a semester and I‚Äôm looking for a furnished apartment near campus. Housing is reimbursed so price is not an issue. The admin guy at UCLA recommended a place called ‚Äúel greco apartments‚Äù: has anyone lived there or been there, by any chance? Thanks a lor in advance! Why is UCLA placed in the east region for MBB The NCAA put out the top 16 teams earlier today and seeded the top 4 teams for each region. UCLA was out at #2 in the east. Anyone know why that is? NCAA March madness seeding is quite a weird process that is never totally clear. The main answer to your question would be that they don‚Äôt necessarily put you in your geographical region. The seeding is done such that every team is ranked 1-68. The number one seed gets to be the 1 in their own region. The #2 overall gets their spot next which will either be the 1 seed in their closest geographical region or the next closest region if the #1 overall is also in their region. Then that process happens with the #3 overall and then the #4 overall gets the 1 seed in which ever region is left. The 5th through the 8th overall seeds go through a similar process. In this ranking I believe Arizona is ranked higher meaning they have first dibs on the west region for second seeds. As you go down the list it gets more complicated as the people in charge try to keep from having teams from the same conference play each other too early so sometimes the location argument based on seeding might get superseded by a team needing to avoid a certain region with a team they‚Äôve already played 2-3 times in the regular season. Basically it‚Äôs a weird ass process that nobody fully understands but regions get screwy quick as they work their way down why?  Lol better than blocking the sidewalk I suppose Uhhh?? You've never seen birds perched on a tree? They tend to do that... I‚Äôm in favor of this rather than them being in garage entrances/exits Did you not learn that birds live in trees?!  Edit: I‚Äôm blind and just noticed someone else made the same joke oops it‚Äôs where they belong idk i can see why this would be funny but i feel bad for the workers that have to collect all of them late at night Why not? i saw some people pushing them over the other day. and it‚Äôs not even because they‚Äôre in the walkway, they were blocking stuff worse than before afterward. maybe it‚Äôs like cow tipping? some people suck Birds in a tree fuck around and find out AM I RIGHT!!!!!! YESSSIRSKY It's really beautiful to see them in their natural habitat It makes me wonder, has OP ever taken a biology class, or any science class for that matter? Like how did they get into UCLA without understanding such a foundational, rudimentary concept? university apartment quality? for anybody who currently lives in a university apartment at ucla, are the walls between rooms in the apartment thick? in other words, if you have a loud suite mate in your apartment, would you get bothered by the noise? Varies by apartment, since they‚Äôre all different, but I‚Äôve never been in one where I heard a neighbor. To be clear, I‚Äôve never lived in one, but I‚Äôve spent a lot of time in a number of them. I think the people living in the apartments are just pretty quiet most of the time tbh. Why don‚Äôt you go over to one and ask someone going in/out? my boyfriend lives in the new university apartments and we hear his suitemate talking to himself and making racist comments every couple of days. I guess they‚Äôre kinda thin or maybe he‚Äôs just loud The wall between my room and my roommate's room is pretty thin (and there's even a gap between it and the ceiling), so I can hear anything that's a normal talking volume or louder. The wall between my room and the adjacent apartment is decent but not great.  In any case, earplugs are a communal living cheat code. I lived in 625 Landfair and i think it‚Äôs one the better apartments. Def didn‚Äôt really hear anything from my roommates across the hall. The rooms have much better space than dorms. If anything, the walls between the bathroom in your room are thin (so for a 2 bed, 2 bath, 4 people, you‚Äôd hear your roommate in the bathroom if they were singing while you‚Äôre in bed. I know from experience) Westwood Palm‚Äôs walls and floors are paper thin. I can hear our upstairs neighbor snoring. You can practically hear everything from everyone. A light footstep from above is still really loud. Don‚Äôt recommend but it‚Äôs honestly not that bad and you‚Äôll eventually get used to it. that‚Äôs a great idea, i‚Äôll do that! and thank u for the info :) anyone know of a place I can go for a dexa scan?  To the cunt that pulled the Rieber Terrace alarm at 5am.. According to the RAS, there are cameras so yo ass is grass. Bro said ‚Äúyo ass is grass‚Äù üíÄüíÄüíÄ (I agree with you) There was a night last year, and I think it was during finals week too, where the alarm went off three-five times(I can't remember) at Reiber Hall.

I'm realizing it's like halfway through the year and still haven't made too many friends on my own. Any way I can pop into a couple clubs this week this late? You can generally sit-in to any club and they‚Äôll be glad to have your interest. There‚Äôs a little guide on the admissions site, and a link to the whole directory there too (though it‚Äôs a bit too hard to parse through that‚Ä¶) thanks ill check that out If anyone was trying to find Sproul cat to help with his limping He‚Äôs currently at Hitch Suites by the Hitchen Please don't try to help him if you don't know what you're doing. As far as I'm aware, the campus cat network has been contacted and were informed about the cat.   /u/slurpee75 posted about the cat earlier and said they contacted the cat network. Not sure if there is another update from them. looking for roommates (f) hi! i‚Äôm a rising 4th year and i‚Äôm looking for roommates to dorm in preferably a plaza double or triple, but i‚Äôm also open to some of the other room types or apartments!  feel free to message me so we can get to know each other or discuss more :)) I messaged you! Need Help Moving Hi everyone. First, my apologies if this is in the wrong sub.   I live in Westwood and need 2 strong people to move a mattress and a dining table to Hermosa Beach this Monday, Feb 20. The mattress itself is 200 pounds, so not exactly an easy thing to lift.  Hiring movers for a job this small is really hard so I thought I‚Äôd try my luck here and see if there were any local UCLA students interested. Paying $100 per person for the work.  I have the uhaul. You‚Äôll need your own car. Job will probably go from 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM. I‚Äôll fill up your gas tank after the job. Please DM me and I‚Äôll be happy to provide more details. PLS HELP ME TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ECON 106F/G/S FOR SPRING QUARTER Which one do you think is the most doable and not stressful? Future Hold Issue For some reason I have \"UG Title IX Req: [sexualharassment.ucla.edu](https://sexualharassment.ucla.edu)\" as one of my future hold reasons, but I have finished the training. Does anybody else have the same issue? CS111 180 Is it doable for me to take CS111 with Eggert, 180 with Ostrovsky, and another course in spring?  I'm planning on taking these two classes since I figured these would be the most helpful for me to learn stuff I'll actually use in SWE interviews/real life. If you have other cs upper-div recommendations, pls let me know too! That'll be pretty rough. While 180 is not as hard as 111, to really benefit from 180 you should have time to lots of problems outside of class \\~10 hours and CS 111 is at-least another 15 to 20 hours. So, if you take another CS upper div, that'll be a very rough quarter. Taking a GE/Ethics/Tech Breath class be the best option thank you so much!!! If I only take one of the two classes, which one is more beneficial in your opinion? ECON 106F/106G/106S for spring quarter?  Mailing room I‚Äôm new to getting mail on campus, when we have to insert ‚Äú Our room & room #‚Äù under what fields do we place that with online ordering ? Address #2 line do any of the new ucla apartment buildings have studio singles? title \\^\\^ i have an accommodation for an off campus studio single and gayley heights looks nice, but i'm not sure which buildings have studio singles None of the new apartments have studio singles. The closest thing is Laurel, Palo Verde, and Tipuana which have 4b/4p units. As far as I know, only Gayley Towers has studios. Looking For a Roommate (F) For Early RSU- De Neve Plaza Double Please message me if interested! Spring Quarter Bruin Bill did anyone else get a charge on bruin bill but no financial aid?? I logged into my.ucla and I don‚Äôt have any holds I have enough financial aid with a sub loan to cover the cost so I shouldn‚Äôt be getting the charge. Is this happening to anyone else? Yes, what I did was just pay for the statement amount before the Spring term.   It'll be fine because a lot of people are going through the same problem. yes me too, i panicked a little because it said no anticipated financial aid on the statement but i know i‚Äôm supposed to get a refund for spring Maybe I‚Äôve lost my mind but this is how it‚Äôs always worked. The charges get posted before financial aid does. They literally emailed out a schedule of when financial aid posts okay i see that makes sense that‚Äôs the same for me i know i also have a loan and that isn‚Äôt popping up If you opted for no loans since the beginning of the year, can you still reapply for loans yeah i‚Äôm pretty sure u just have to call go to your efan and accept or call ucla financial aid too Do we still receive routine financial aid of same amount if we choose to Taken on loans or get reduced aid since we take on loans? that idk i‚Äôve always had a loan so i‚Äôm not sure Chem 14CL materials Do we need a lab coat and goggles, etc for Chem 14CL since they're in person now? Yes you do financial aid refunds i see we‚Äôre supposed to pay the housing bill for the term soon, i was wondering when financial aid would be refunded Refunds are distributed a few days before each quarter your refund should hit during spring break RSU Roommate group SINGLE pod Hey guys, I am looking to form a roommate group with another male who is interested in grabbing a single pod room for next year during the early RSU. Please DM me with your contact info if you're interested! UCLA Ranked #7 in 2022 Putnam Mathematical Competition 1. MIT 2. Harvard 3. Stanford 4. Maryland 5. Yale  \\#6 - 10 (ordering unknown):  * CMU * Columbia * Princeton * UCLA * Toronto  UCLA rank: [https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/ucla-putnam-team-ranks-7-out-of-456-institutions/](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/ucla-putnam-team-ranks-7-out-of-456-institutions/)  Results: [https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Putnam/2022/AnnouncementOfWinnersFall2022.docx%20%281%29.pdf](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Putnam/2022/AnnouncementOfWinnersFall2022.docx%20%281%29.pdf) What happened? Thought we were always in top 5? Nice work, bruins! I took the Putnam cuz I thought I was good at math. I got a zero. Six (8? It was a long ass time ago) hours of work and they were like \"you dumb\" still pretty high UCLA's TEAM was ranked 7th.   Our students lost to UCSD, BYU, Brandeis, Binghampton, McGill, Swarthmore, University of Wisconsin, University of Maryland, and the University of Toronto.  It's embarrassing to say the least. All of the Math Undergraduate Merit Scholarship (MUMS) recipients graduated.  https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/ucla-math-undergraduate-merit-scholarship/ Considering Princeton (No. 1 math school in the world) didn‚Äôt make top 5 either, we ain‚Äôt too bad‚Ä¶ Why is it embarrassing to you that a single BYU student happened to score in the top 25? That dude scored better than 45 MIT students. Realistically not every UCLA participant can be top-25 in the nation.   EDIT: After some internet snooping it looks like the BYU student has published math research and turned down MIT to study in Provo. UCLA has sucked at its job for the past 4-5 years.  Not only are they no longer recruiting math skills, they don't know how to develop them anymore.  Why there is a single full ride scholarship a year for mathematics, is mind boggling. Did I say it was? I made a list, and he probably didn't want to go to MIT bc he's mormon. > It's embarrassing to say the least. Enrollment Hold for physics Hi!  I am looking for someone to hold a spot for me for physics 5c. I am willing to pay A LOT because I need it for my major requirements so let me know if you are interested! CS major missed 130, am I screwed? I missed my first-pass and couldn't enroll in CS 130. It's my last quarter here. I already submitted an ECR. Is there anything else I should do? Or do I have to suck it up and take 152B? The engineering counselors will do their darndest to enroll you in CS 130 since you're graduating, so all hope is not lost.  If they don't, you will need to enroll in both 152B AND CS 132 (assuming you're CS and not CSE or CE), since you have to take one of CS 130 or 132. Looking to join a rsu group (male) for single plaza pods üò© Rising 3rd year, my early rsu time is 3/7 at 11:15 AM. Prefer rieber vista, but any building is fine w me too.

Holding Physics 5C Hello, if any upperclassman is willing to hold physics 5c until Monday afternoon, please pm me! I‚Äôm willing to pay. I need this class to graduate on time and I don‚Äôt have a good enrollment pass :((( (hypothetically) if a delivery driver runs an errand for me and purchases alcohol, how much should I tip? $15 bottle, $16 w tax, I feel like 20% is too low for them going out of their way, but idk how much to do. give them $25? A $9 tip????? looking for a pair of roommates! my roommate and i (both f) are looking for another pair of roommates for a 2bed/4ppl university apartment next year! we‚Äôre both currently 3rd year stem majors and looking for people with similar home lifestyles. if you‚Äôre interested and want to meet up and see how we vibe pm me :) here are our preferences for living:  - wash dishes / put them in the dishwasher as they‚Äôre being used (not letting them pile up)  - general cleaning up after ourselves (wiping up spills, throwing out garbage, etc) - having friends over is fine, no permission really needed! ofc if it‚Äôs in the evening just keep it at a reasonable noise level. overnight guests can just be cleared between our direct roommates, but for multiple nights we prefer to clear it with the entire apartment - drinking and smoking is fine too! tho preferably, not every night   - if you‚Äôd like to join in on nights out, that‚Äôd be super cool as well Middle eastern food on the hill? Feel like we could really use some, even if the feast could have a middle eastern pop up every few weeks. Epicuria sometimes does right? PSA: don‚Äôt stare at people at the gym Is it just me or do so many guys at wooden have a staring problem? My roommates and I were at wooden the other day and this guy was staring at us the whole time we were squatting, and we could see his reflection in the window. We each made eye contact with him multiple times. This also isn‚Äôt the first time this happened either tbh, so to the guy in the bright ass yellow shirt, put those eyes away. Maybe he was looking past you, not at you yeah has it ever occurred to you that people can look in your direction and space out while between sets for example? or just look around while resting? really normal if people are into the gym and don‚Äôt use their phone there. It wasn‚Äôt today(Friday) right? Cuz I wore a yellow shirt today, but I kinda get lost in my music and stare at ppl accidentally Make a Tiktok about it Glare back at him lol when i trained at wooden i would often space out in between sets and stare at literally nothing. if it bothers you so much just go tell him to stop staring at you i guess. das why i go to bfit üòé trust me they dont care about looking at ur ass This is only tangentially related to this post (I have no idea what you were wearing), but I would also be super paranoid about people looking at me if I was wearing a crotch-tight athletic speedo and no top to wooden every day.   It‚Äôs too bad that the current trend is womens ‚Äúathletic wear‚Äù is basically athletic underwear. I‚Äôm a guy and I see way to many crotches, sweaty asses and boobs at wooden and it‚Äôs getting gross and honestly I‚Äôm not sure where to look some of the time (the ceiling?). Not saying chicks need to ‚Äúcover up‚Äù but perhaps people would be less concerned about pervs if they wore normal running shorts/ bikes shorts and tank tops rather than bikinis bottoms that leave gross buttsweat stains on the benches. Just saying.  Edit: And tbc I‚Äôm blaming marketers and these companies for this clothing not women themselves‚Ä¶ but my point is there‚Äôs no way I would feel comfortable wearing that shit as a man so I‚Äôm sorry that this has become the norm. people get bored and look at things/ppl in the gym yeah i sometimes switch to sports bra when hitting back and bi and guys will not even care abt being discreet and stare down my chest lol it‚Äôs uncomfortable Women check men out all the time. Men have the right to check women out imo. You don‚Äôt have to like it, but you can accept it. no I definitely understand spacing out and looking around the gym but this guy was helping his friend film his set but staring at us while we did our sets and it made myself and my roommates extremely uncomfortable Wtf how is that an excuse i agree! i‚Äôm a girl and i hate that this is what women‚Äôs athletic wear has come to and i don‚Äôt find it cute or appropriate enough to wear to the gymüò≠ ‚ÄúHow dare you look in my direction. Even though you aren‚Äôt directly looking at me, your head is pointed somewhat toward me, and that‚Äôs not okay. It makes me uncomfortable that I can see both of your eyes at the same time.

Help: Trying to switch into Astrophysics Hey, so I'm currently a 2nd year Computational and Systems Biology Major. I want to switch my major to Astrophysics and I am prepared and happy to take a 5th here to complete all the classes. I was wondering if anyone has been in a similar position. I know that the first step would be to get a lot of the Physics pre-recs under my belt. After that I would apply for extra time for my degree and also apply to the Physics department. How likely is it that UCLA will grant me the extra quarters? How likely is it that the Physics department will except me into their department. Keep in mind that my GPA is high and I have done well in the few Astrophysics pre recs that I have taken so far.   Any thoughts would be really appreciated. Talk to both departments' undergraduate advisors.  They will have a much better idea of your situation based on your prior coursework.  It will likely come down to how many quarters you have left and how many course requirements you would still need to fulfill.  Sounds doable based on your description. Will do. Thanks for the reply. Odhiambo for Stats 100B? Has anyone ever taken a class with Odhiambo before? He's the only professor for Stats 100B next quarter. Have stats 10 w him rn. Chill.

I have priority enrollment so for upcoming fall quarter I can save a class for you in exchange or I‚Äôll pay! Wait why do you need someone to save u a spot in summer classes ? There‚Äôs no enrollment appointments for summer so you can just enroll The psych class I want is full so I was hoping for someone to drop it in exchange for me saving a future class for them or paying them :) Advice on which professor to take for Math 33A? Ignore the rating for Gannon, it's linking a professor that taught an architecture class and a comms class so I don't think it's the right one.  https://preview.redd.it/b41jgqessuia1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=be8bfe5749c93118615a603f5ab487137a556b1d i‚Äôm not sure if gannon is kyle gannon since todd gannon doesn‚Äôt seem right, but if it is he‚Äôs great, best math prof i had tbh min and gannon are both great. haven't taken any classes with shin. i would just pick whichever is best for your schedule, you'll be fine with either. i think it's referring to tom gannon, the new gannon who started fall quarter i think? That‚Äôs correct it‚Äôs Tom Gannon. Regarding the selection all three are good choices. Hold Econ 2 Is anyone able to hold Econ 2 for me?

EEB 142 with Knowles, B.? Has anyone taken this class with this professor? How was it? There are no reviews on bruinwalk, and I'm trying to have a chill final quarter. Didn‚Äôt have him for that class, but he‚Äôs really nice! He‚Äôs usually pretty lenient and will help work around students needs so that it‚Äôs more about learning the material than cramming info, so I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs pretty chill. He also just really likes viruses lol I had it with Kane and it was really good. I have Knowles as a professor right now and they are really great and chill. I definitely recommend taking the class.

I can‚Äôt seem to find anything on Bruinwalk for C.L. Johnson so I thought I‚Äôd ask here which one you‚Äôd suggest. Mutlu was pretty bad at teaching for math 31A and it was online recorded when I took it. Wouldn‚Äôt take her again for any class if I had the choice. The exams are very similar to the practice exams tho but the final was 10x harder in my opinion. My experience with Johnson has been pretty low key so far I‚Äôve done better on her midterm than any math class I‚Äôve taken so far at ucla I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd recommend Johnson Mutlu has super easy tests for 33a i like mutlu‚Äôs teaching style. It‚Äôs easy to understand, by the book, with lots of examples (110A). She solves problems in OH for you if you ask. She gives midterm review problems. Idk she‚Äôs my vibe as a professor but some people don‚Äôt like when they follow the textbook to a tee so up to you. I have Mutlu right now for 33A and I think she's a great prof! She goes a little quick during lectures but she posts slides afterwards so you can reread them to catch up.

I asked mailroom and they said ok not related to the hill, but people in the new UA weyburn apartments would amazon fresh raw chicken breasts and they‚Äôd sit in the mailroom for at least a day Math 151A with Aceves S√°nchez or Schaeffer? Hi guys, does anyone have any experience with either Professor? Or know anything about them? I can‚Äôt seem to find anything on Bruinwalk for them so I thought I‚Äôd ask here. I had Aceves S√°nchez for 134 and I enjoyed his class, he‚Äôs a great prof Aceves Sanchez is your better option. He has taught the class a lot in two years. Schaeffer is a former grad student of the Dept who is now coming back to UCLA as a full rank professor I took 151a with Sanchez last quarter, and I'm really not a fan of the class in general, but I'm not a total fan of him either. He organizes BruinLearn weirdly, and his uploaded slides (before and after annotation) were difficult for me to find and read. His exams were fair though, so I'd say just go for it. I'd advocate for Aceves Sanchez. Lectures might be dry but theyre surprisingly understandable. Exams more than fair. Had him fall quarter RA Group Decisions Should we be hearing back tonight or tomorrow? my group told me they‚Äôd let us know sometime this weekend so i‚Äôm assuming saturday or sunday but i‚Äôm not sure Thank you! ofc ü´∂ü´∂ Transferring to CS major grade concern. Asking on behalf of a friend. I'm a freshman in chemistry major and I'm considering either switching to CS major or picking it up as a minor. I overestimated how many courses I could handle this quarter and because of that, I am struggling in my physics class. I think I could barely finish with a low B but I'm not doing super well in my other classes either so I am worried about my GPA. I am wondering if it is still possible for me to have a chance at switching to CS because I know that it is extremely competitive. I can provide extra details of my situation if more information is needed, but I really want to know if transferring to CS is feasible at this point. 3.5 GPA minimum in CS prep courses Honestly, it is possible but you‚Äôll have to basically get straight As for every other CS pre req, and those aren‚Äôt easy. If I were you I‚Äôd look into the bioinformatics minor, though. It has some really cool classes. Along with that, you can just take CS classes outside of the minor when they are available.   Unless you really aren‚Äôt enjoying chemistry, chem and bioinformatics sounds dope as hell lol. Missing id by the parking lot otw to the hill if anyone sees a ucla id on the floor on the way to the hill from the fowler museum way PLS lmk (charles young dr)! Any thoughts about my schedule? &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/h1js22xwttia1.png?width=2354&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b3cfe9c27953c3a6e01fd47e36a1967a3711e5c2 There aren't any overlaps. This isn't enough.   You gotta pump those numbers up. These are rookie numbers. I mean there are a LOT of 10 minute breaks, but it‚Äôs understandable to want to take it easy for a quarter. why aren't you taking any ece classes Not enough math classes tbh. Don‚Äôt you want to challenge yourself??? Ending your day at 5 is way too easy. 8 PM should be the absolute minimum. At this rate, you won't graduate by 16, so I'd say you're falling behind. Maybe add a few organic chem classes and take a few physics classes with Corbin. How many units would this even be Lectures are recorded you can take more Why no upper division classes?  Lazy.  You never be good like your brother like that. Very funny and original! I assume you‚Äôll be working too Average engineer major No Saturday or Sunday classes smh May as well add Physics 1C and get the whole series over with, considering how light your schedule is so far. Tuesday: am I a joke to you? I myself, I take 20 classes per day: 10 in the morning right after i work out, then 10 right after lunch. And all of them lower div?! 69 Unpopular opinion: Engineers fr gotta get off their ‚Äúwe have to take so many classes‚Äù high horse. Nice Rookie numbers. You should do at least 420 units to challenge yourself I understand where you‚Äôre coming from but you deadass have to take at least 4 classes every quarter just to barely be able to graduate in 4 years üò≠ Sociology 1 With Speer Just wondering, does speer record his lectures? Or is participation required in lectures? Because im really not tryna go to that 8AM lecture I took Speer for 110 - Lectures were recorded and he posted his slides on Bruinlearn as well. He still encouraged coming to class and he reserved the right to no longer post them and/or give EC towards the end of the semester to those that do attend, if attendance goes down drastically. (And his midterm / finals are 90/95% based off lecture w/only a few reading questions).  I would suggest at least going for the first day / wait for the syllabus - it'll say his policy on there as, due to the early time, he may change it.  (But I really enjoyed him as a Professor and I thought the grading / assignments, etc. were pretty easy and it was a light work load.) He really encourages attendance and would be super upset when lots of people didn‚Äôt show, so I would depend on going. He also gives extra credit for attendance Physics sequence for UCLA biology transfer Has anyone been a biology major and transferred to UCLA? On assist, it says I can either take college physics (which I believe is a two semester algebra based physics) or a three semester engineering physics sequence (which I believe is calculus based). Since I am a life science major, I was just going to take the college physics, but on their website, it says they recommend one year of calculus based physics before transfer. My question is, has anyone taken the algebra two semester based physics at their community college and transferred it over to UCLA without having to take additional physics classes? It says the college physics class I want to take is equivalent to the physics 5 sequence at UCLA. I transferred as a bio major last year (currently a 4th year) and only took 2 semesters of algebra-based physics at my cc which was enough to meet the physics requirement. I didn‚Äôt have to take any additional physics classes here so you should be alright! good luck! I didn‚Äôt even take Physics at CC and I got in. Gender Inclusive Housing Hey I (female) and my roommate (female) are creating a group with some of our friends (male) to get the best time for all of us. We want the same building but different rooms as we only indicated gender inclusive to have the same time. We will be in triples. How likely will be get paired with a different gender if we indicate gender inclusive?   Thanks!!! If you are not comfortable with living with someone who is not of your gender and are concerned about the probably that you will be, I would advise you to opt out immediately. There isn‚Äôt any data on who they could assign you, but I would say you have equal chances either way as the person they put in your room will have also selected gender inclusive on their form so there is no guarantee.  In the future: I‚Äôm sure you had good intentions to help your friends out but I feel like using this preference in this way is kind of insensitive to students who do in fact use the gender inclusive housing as a safe way to live with people who they feel personally comfortable with- so please just be mindful of that.  Hope it works out well for you! Youre gonna regret that People who exit their drink option @ Epicuria's soda machine >>>  Please do not encourage this. On average it's actually less taps and thus less hand movement per person to not exit:  Without exit, each person does:  1. Tap exit.  2. Tap option.  3. Tap pour.  With exit, each person does:  1. Tap option.  2. Tap pour.  3. Tap exit.  There is a nonzero probability that the next person will choose the same option, so it is possible in the non-exit case to save an exit tap. In the exit case, however, no taps will ever be saved. Based greedy algorithm Rende East boba Is it any good??? Take the average of every boba place ever. Then go down a couple percentiles.

It says they notify people by week 6 of the quarter that they applied I have applied and no response yet :/ Is taking a GE p/np bad for grad school? Can any grad or even undergrad students offer some advice? If I don‚Äôt take this GE p/np there is a chance it will hurt my gpa. How important is it to take GEs for a letter grade?   I will say this is the only GE I would be pass/no passing, but it is also a humanities GE and I would be applying to grad school in a humanities field (though not the same field) idk about every grad school, but for law school at least, it doesn‚Äôt matter at all unless you have a ton of Ps. I would P/NP it If it's one class it won't have a big effect..if you have a lot of Ps instead of letter grades it isn't great. Some schools will review passes as Cs and recalculate gpa but not all. GEs are not important for grad school. Research ability is the most important factor. Better to do a p/np on one class than it hurt your gpa imo.  And one np also won't ruin you for grad school worst case. anyone in the professional writing minor Can u PLSSS hold a class for me :0 pls message me Physics 5c spring quarter Can someone PLEASE hold a spot for me in physics 5C I'm willing to pay!!!

But to make a more informed decision prolly look at hotseat. first pass cs 32, ece 3 will open up more spots, the department always opens more spots as enrollment progresses and is usually pretty flexible on increasing enrollment for this class are dining halls open during August?

Drove by a big line of people waiting for something by the Amazon Hub on Westwood Blvd last night, they were all dressed up. Just curious what it was for. szn 3 Outer Banks premiere tired of mf message center idk about other majors but. nothing pisses me off more than reading a 4+ year old post about how someone was able to fix a simple problem by simply walking into their department counselors office and talking to them about the issue and getting it fixed. im truly sick of having to use fucking message center to talk to my department counselor. LITERALLY NONE OF THE PSYCH DEPARTMENT COUNSELORS ARE AVAILABLE. using covid as an excuse for this shit is honestly such bullshit at this point. i feel like every aspect of my college experience has been shit on by covid and this small detail is enough to set me over the fucking edge. its 4am and im sleep deprived as im writing this but i swear to GODDD ucla pisses me off so fucking much bruh. this is such bullshit That sucks, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to deal with that :(   I didn‚Äôt even realize that‚Äôs a thing some departments were still doing. Maybe it‚Äôs also because it‚Äôs a bigger department? Rn the classics department will just let you walk right into anyone‚Äôs office if you need to talk to them. i feel u ttly, my gpa during the ol qtrs plummeted just felt like not enough support from the school, and the resources, guidelines, etc. were so hard to navigate   although must say the stats dept has been very efficient with the msg center.. I'm right there with you. Just remember this when they come looking for alum donations... they ain't getting one more penny from me with how fucked my experience has been I dont think ive gotten a response from the message center in the past 2 years Same for Econ department. They only communicate with you through this message center, where you have to wait for one to two working days to get a reply. Last time I made an appointment with them they only got two counselors available and I need to wait for half a month to get a 15 minutes slot. Ridiculous. damn thats so nice. i prefer to talk to people face to face so im jealous. nearly every time i use message center for a problem the replies are always cold and never accommodating. probably bc they dont actually have to face us lmao econ double major?? hi i‚Äôm currently a poli sci major, but i‚Äôm planning to double with econ. i‚Äôm just a bit worried about the difficulty bc im planning on law school and idk if i should double in something easier for the sake of my gpa. is anyone a double poli sci/econ major or just general advice?? pls and thank u :) i had the same concerns a while ago but it depends on your interests.  for the sake of double majoring? idk if law schools will be impressed, but if you like econ and do well in it, sure. if you don't do so well, drop it and/or pick something else. the classes tend to give around a/a- to 30% of the students based on curve and almost all are curved. tbh it's like a math degree, you're learning how to apply math. i'd say if you work hard enough and are good at math, you can do good. try taking econ 11. it can give you a good idea.  for job prospects? meh. most of the econ classes are quite too theoretical to be applied. you'd be better off just learning from youtube. or do a minor in accounting or statistics. the applicable knowledge in econ classes is mostly accounting/stats and just taking direct accounting or stats courses would be easier. for other topics, the classes are good but not really helpful if you expect much. As an econ/polisci double, I‚Äôd say that it definitely is a tradeoff. Econ affecting your gpa is no joke, and you really have to work for it. It‚Äôs not impossible, but not a cake walk either.   Also depends what kind of law you want to go into. I‚Äôm enjoying my econ degree because it opens doors for me to get consulting/corporate experience before I go into business law. It all depends.  I personally enjoy the balance of both. I get to write essays about social issues and I get to use models to understand how things objectively work. It‚Äôs a win for me.  TL;DR: depends if you like econ and think it will enrich your experience. Don‚Äôt do it to ‚Äúlook good‚Äù >the applicable knowledge in econ classes is mostly accounting/stats and just taking direct accounting or stats courses would be easier  Very true. You're much better of taking stats than econ for the econometric classes. Or just do a social data science minor and you can take any of the econometrics classes anyways, without the economic theory (assuming you only care about job prospects). Ling 1 with Rett (summer) since i have no faith im gonna be able to get ling 1 for spring quarter, im curious if anyone‚Äôs taken ling 1 with rett (in general or over the summer). How are they? Kinda nervous since they have a 2.6 rating on bruinwalk‚Ä¶ can hold a class for a fee dm me how much tho Math 115a professor options How are sanchez ocal, wong, and johnson, c.l for math 115a? only wong has bruinwalk reviews but I want options in case I don't get into his section. Best way to get to and from Crypto.com Arena I want to go see a Lakers or Clippers game this quarter. What is the best way to travel between UCLA & Crypto.com Arena for people without a car? I know you can take the Expo line there, but I'm not sure if that's possible coming back. Wondering if anyone had any experience they like to share :) You can take the expo line both ways! The stop to get off is Pico Station but alternatives are the 2 and 233 bus lines or 33 and R12 lines It was and will always be known as the Staple Center Don't see the Clippers. LA belongs to the Lakers. Damm boy I Wana be there with you Hmm I think I'll take the bus & the Expo line to the game, but I'm not sure if the bus will still be running after the game. Is it safe to get off at Expo/Sepulveda & get an Uber from there? Not with this fucking record. Best case scenario is they are play in champs this year Depending how late it is they run every 30 mins to an hr so there‚Äôs that but the expo line is more consistent during the night coming more frequently and Expo/Sep√∫lveda and Expo/Westwood Rancho Park both work as stops to get off and call an Uber. Wtb the study swipes  Anyone ever take those 12 unit summer language classes? How are they? Coming as someone who would be new to the language but willing to learn. I see German 8, French 8, Greek 8, Hebrew 8, Latin 8, Japanese 9 (advanced), Romanian 6, Russian 8, Serbian/Croatian 8. My only concern would be doing a language course online. Doesn‚Äôt seem as immersive as it should be (if we‚Äôre genuinely trying to learn the language).         How is the course load?        How are the assignments & exams?          How is the immersion/language learning, being online?           How ‚Äúeasy‚Äù is it?            Are they beginner friendly (aside from Japanese)?        Any other suggestions/tips? Anyone else unable to enroll in Chem 114? The system thinks I dont have the prereqs to take this class, but I have them, its literally the last class I need to graduate  From what I heard it seems other people are also having this issue No Contact the message centre Single Pod Female Hi I‚Äôm looking for females who want a single pod in Rieber Terrace next year. Lmk if you want to join my roommate group. ME I'd like to join! How should I study for Enders Psych 100a midterm?  tldr city targets suck title + going home and seeing a regular size target and how nice and stocked they are makes me wonder why our target always looks like the victim of a post apocalyptic raid üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßçüßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The Westwood Target is like a Costco compared to the Target on Wilshire & 16th in Santa Monica. That one is truly terrible. LA targets are okay, just the ones in West LA kinda suck. Both the ones I go to in Van Nuys and Woodland Hills are pretty nice and standard. aside from valentine's day candy what did you notice was out of stock at the Westwood target? City Target is a small format Target... obviously it's not going to have the same range of choices as a full-size Target out in the suburbs where there is enough space for a big store with a big parking lot. ^ this. The Westwood Target actually has decent selection for its size. The ones in Santa Monica and West LA (SM Blvd and west gate?) are pretty bad in comparison It‚Äôs not so much that they‚Äôre out of stock in the stuff they carry, it‚Äôs that their selection is *terrible* No one is arguing the need for city targets vs full size ones lmao it‚Äôs just the shock of having everything well stocked and having a more diverse selection ü´° This! Looking for one more (F) roommate hi! currently looking for one more roommate to join our rsu group‚Äî we really want a 4b/4p and would want someone who has an earlier time on their rsu than ours. A little bit about me is that im a political science major, from LA (ill show you all the spots :D) and my roommates and I consider ourselves clean, organized and understanding. PM me or comment if you‚Äôre interested and we can talk more about preferences, etc. Thanks! To the girl carrying the LSAT Trainer in Epicuria, I sympathize with your pain. :( How do I disable the light motion sensor in my dorm? I'm in the top bunk and whenever my roommates aren't hear (which is often) I have to get down every 15 minutes because the light in my room turns off by itself. Any way to get around this? Get something long you can fit on your bed so you can wave it around. Alternatively, get something that moves automatically and place it in front of the sensor. Get LED lights- non expensive obviously- something cheap from Amazon can go long ways hehe like those cat wand toys can someone recommend me a really easy (possibly async) historical or social GE need to take one last historical or social analysis GE next quarter. does anyone have a really fun one or one that's just really easy or asynchronous that they could recommend to me? thank you! geog 7?

First of all, Im so sorry, I know the hopelessness of knowing you're failing. Especially because of a bad professor. If I were you, I'd keep going to class/following the material. Even if you're not picking it up during this quarter, it'll at least be recognizable the next quarter you take it. It'll help you get ahead for next time. Plus, you're paying for the class, may as well try to absorb as much as you can. Why can‚Äôt you drop thanks! that seems like sound advice its impacted and i can only do it with a very serious reason supppsedly Hold Psych 120A If you can hold Psych 120A until my second pass (Feb. 26th), I will pay you $100.

I‚Äôm also a first year, but almost my whole floor is made of of people that were in centennial last year that chose to return.

Thank you for the input! : ) Go to the broad museum or Santa barbara Nearby is The Getty, the Broad, Mulholland Drive, Vista Hermosa Natural Park, Malibu Creek Rock Pools! i always say take em to a dining hall if you can just to flex. the broad or getty might be fun!! huntington library is a bit out of the way and expensive BUT super duper pretty Getty followed up with dinner in Sawtelle is a nice day  Even if you aren't into art, the architecture and views are great.   Japantown, Ktown kbbq and Korean shaved ice, DTLA (last book store and Walt Disney concert hall) are also nice. Getty villa is decent. Math 170s with Wu, T Is anyone taking this professor for Math 170s right now? How is the class? Is it easier than stats100B? He's not good. Very often feels like he gets lost in his own lecture, over 15+ people show up to every one of my TA's OH, midterm was hard He talks a bit slow but I‚Äôd say the difficulty is reasonable, just took the midterm and it was ok. No idea how it compares to stats 100b tho can anyone with enrollment today hold polisci 60 for good pay hi can anyone with enrollment today hold polisci 60 for me for very good pay I really need to take it this quarter,,, message me :) Ride your scooter ON THE CORRECT SIDE OF THE ROAD omf Almost had a head-on collision going down the bike lane on De Neve drive because dumb ass people ride the scooters up the Hill ON THEIR LEFT SIDE. There are so many blind spots pls just stop being fucking stupid with your friends and pay attention to the sign on the road that says to ride on the right. happens to me every other time I scooter down that road. there needs to be a permit system for riding scooters. half the people here will fail. No fr and making us all look bad too PIC 10A with Burnett Is anyone else struggling with the homework for this class?

Damn didnt have a chance at this rate Didn‚Äôt even add it to my planner I knew she would be gone in a second ü•≤ course/language recs for specialization in computing starting out with a specialization in computing (currently cog sci) and wanted to hear if people had any recommendations for either continuing with the pic 10 series (c++) or jump around with languages like in pic 16a (python) or matlab?   &#x200B;  I know that this is very dependent on what you wanna do in the future but would greatly appreciate hearing anyone's personal experiences with this type of stuff :\\] hey! i‚Äôm a current cog sci major who took pic 10a this fall and am taking 16a right now and tbhhhh i feel like i‚Äôd recommend taking either the entire 10 series or 10a and 10b before starting a new language. At least for me they definitely teach new languages thinking you have a pretty strong foundation in c++ , so they go rather fast imo BUT if you feel good with c++ i‚Äôm sure you can do well jumping from 10a to another language as long as you study up I chose to learn the cs31, 32 series because I'm hoping to take some CS upper-division classes. If you don't want to, I think stats20 is a great class. It's about R programming and is much easier than pic 16a. The stats department recommends to take this class after psych 100A, but it actually only involves some really simple stats concepts, such as means and standard deviations. Chill Coding Club? Hii! I was wondering if anyone could recommend some clubs on campus that cater to people interested in coding! I've taken a few classes but I really want to learn more languages and prep for internships, preferably in a chill, low-commitment environment with nice people :) Acm game studio has workshops where you can learn coding stuff and also game jams where you can apply it :) check out acm teach la‚Äôs dev team!

Whoever had the blue badger pin on their backpack today, wanted to say hi but had to get to class lol Also had a herlock charm? I think? Was moving kinda fast lol Film minor/major hold spot for me in 106B Hi, I was wondering if any film majors/minors would be able to hold a spot for me in 106B until my second pass (Feb 27th) Willing to pay -- msg me! First pass CHEM 153A or AN N EA 10W (Jerusalem Class) I need to take these two classes in addition to another class that I MUST use my first pass on. Does anyone have any idea which of these two fill up faster?   I‚Äôm senior standing with a very early second pass if that makes a difference.  Appreciate it, thanks! DH Capstone (187) Hi, I want to apply to DH 187 but there's limited spots and I'm kind of worried i won't be able to get in, however last quarter i overheard my professor talking to someone about how anyone who is on the waitlist for the DH capstone class gets in. Can someone confirm? Do any transfers remember when they sent their transcripts during the application process? I‚Äôm at the cc now and applied to transfer for the fall ‚Äò23 term. the only things i‚Äôve done so far for the transfer process have been the application and updated spring grades. other colleges i applied to have reached out requesting transcripts from my cc but UCLA hasn‚Äôt yet. i‚Äôm kinda freaking myself out and have been convincing myself i missed the deadline to turn them in. does anyone remember when in the application process they sent UCLA transcripts? [https://admission.ucla.edu/admitted-students/transfers-submit-transcripts](https://admission.ucla.edu/admitted-students/transfers-submit-transcripts) these are the deadlines for transcripts and other records for transfers, you're good Yes you do thank you so much! i thought they would‚Äôve wanted transcript‚Äôs before sending out acceptances which is why i was freaking out so much lol Still looking for a female roommate!! Hey again :3 I'm a rising third year and my friend and I are looking for a third roommate to dorm with next year!!  We're interested in a plaza triple, shared bath. Sooooo if you're interested or you want more info about us, feel free to message me! <3 MAE 107 Im a mech engineering major and I‚Äôm planning on taking the so called ‚Äúhardest course‚Äù over the summer so I can focus on it solely. But can anyone who‚Äôs done so offer their thoughts. Is it a good idea, should I prepare to cry, or what.   Taking it with Kim, D.D. If that makes a difference. Took 107 with Kim last quarter. He‚Äôs a good professor. It‚Äôs def a challenging course, but not impossible. In addition to hw, midterm and final, there‚Äôs a healthy amount of lab work, which in the case of my course, amounted to 3-4 hours of additional work per week. I‚Äôve heard mixed things about 107 profs, but would say that Kim is a preferred choice. I also felt that he was genuinely committed to the success of his students, which came through in his lecture style. All in all, your summer will be a lot of work, but I think you‚Äôre in pretty good hands. Any Poli sci majors willing to hold a class? Will pay! Hii if you‚Äôre a declared Poli Sci major with a good enrollment pass and are willing to hold a class for me, please lmk! I‚Äôll pay (price is negotiable) The Study now serving muffins w spiders üòç  jesus christ Extra protein for the gainz WHAT THE HELL Please report this to the dining manger in the Study. They are responsible for ensuring stuff like this never happens How did you notice this Was it yummy ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. crumchy Love it! I prefer mine with extra hairy legsüòç An average meal for spiders georg Wtf id eat it tbh It looks like it could be a raisin but then again it kinda looks like a spider. If it was a spider how did it get in I wonder I can't believe people still unironically say that UCLA has the best college food in the nation/world Well, that‚Äôs gross At least it's not a tarantula It was factored into the cost you paid for that muffin, therefore you must eat it! :) on god This comment had me cracking up I've heard people say the eyes are the best part of fish.    8 eyes in this one. Eyes? LMAO Lmao they do? It was definitely top tier before covid but man it went downhill quick. Graduated so no idea how it is now I‚Äôm getting finger in the chili vibes Does chem 153A usually fill up first pass?  I don‚Äôt remember if it filled up first pass, but I remember a lot of people dropping + a lot of spots opened up later on! Also, I heard the professor had bad reviews so that might affect how many people take it as well LOL.. 4/4 RSU (M) I am a second year and my RSU time is at 10 am on the 7thüò© I am trying to join a group. I am pretty organized and likes to keep common spaces clean. I don‚Äôt smoke or drink. Please dm me if interested Sandwich Shrinkflation? Is anyone else noticing UCLA‚Äôs dining sandwiches seem much smaller this year? I‚Äôve been suspecting that my study sammies were slightly smaller, and I just got a BBQ beef brisket sandwich from bcafe and I could swear it had 70% of the mass it had last year. The study sandwiches used to be phat squares and now they‚Äôre ovals :( Blaze pizza too [removed] Someone‚Äôs insecure about their penis size Hold physics 5c Hello! Could someone hold physics 5c for me? I need to take it before next year and I don't want to take it over the summer. I'm willing to pay! Why can‚Äôt ppl have some general etiquette at dining halls Just got my plate of food and drink spilled all over me, because some girl raised her arm to hug her friend right next to the exit of the food line. Not sure why they thought that was a good place to chat‚Ä¶ Seriously. Idk how comfortable they can be like that. Fuck that People at the dining halls give no shits. They will see you carrying plates full of food and they will come at you 100MPH regardless. It's a free for all. I used to try to be conscientious of other people at the dining halls but I don't care anymore. Should have sidestepped, sounds like a skill issue dining halls are an extension of our home‚Ä¶ people should be comfortable there and can act how they want, within reason. this sounds like people having fun in the dining hall caused an accident; as long as they apologized, i don‚Äôt see the issue. i get that this was annoying but truly seems like an accident It was an accident‚Ä¶ chill Dining halls have always been a kind of free-for-all but I noticed it was extra bad once dining halls reopened after covid. 1-2 years of isolation destroyed any semblance of some people's manners it seems lmao Unfortunately I had no vision bc the exit of the food line faced an opposite direction :c Any shift key enjoyers? While I agree with this, I‚Äôve seen many people in the dining halls have 0 spatial or social awareness.  One time I remember I was waiting for a dude to refill his drink at the soda fountain. He just kept refilling and drinking it over and over.   After the third time I tapped him on the shoulder since a line was now forming and he totally freaked out. As if he didn‚Äôt realize he was in a public place An accident that could be avoided with a modicum of self awareness You know you've really outdone yourself when your professor hits you with this feedback on your midterm  omg this would make me cry üò≠ this is sparta This is my 13th reason it‚Äôs giving math/physics energy rip reply with you‚Äôre just a nonsense-able person. Must be a cool prof, or a cool class, or a cool topic, or maybe you really made no sense?? Is this real?? Lmfaoooooo me lmao, this is peak professoring. makes it easier to improve/impress in finals ;) I feel it oh my god lol Sometimes when I don't know the answer, I write nonsense so I'd totally expect this üòÇ LOL you guessed it, it's physics Well yeah in his defence, my answer really was nonsense. Def still a cool prof No, This is nonsense. Lol which professor? Hahhaa Bahaha i saw this comment coming if they say bauer im gonna flip a table you know this school is sth when people are paying others $$ to enroll classes. no.1 public school Pay to win :| Can someone please hold PSYCH 162 for me?? I am in desperate need of this class and I am willing to pay $20/$25 for whoever can hold it for me. PLEASE I NEED THIS CLASS Scooters be warned... Finally Finally, it is happening. UCLA PD is ticketing scooters running stop signs. I watched 4 scooters get pulled over in 10 minutes for running stop signs. üéâ  Y'all are coded in CA law as MOTORIZED VEHICLES. Thus you must obey traffic laws. Everyone is tired of almost getting run over by you running stop signs and zipping on sidewalks.   Let me remind you.   1. it is illegal to ride on side walks with scooters.  2. It is illegal to disobey traffic laws on scooters.  3. Pedestrians have the right of way in crosswalks and sidewalks, not you.   Also, if you're in the road going 10 mph in the fast lane you bet were going to honk at you until you move over. I get they're convenient but damn you're pests on the sidewalk and pests in the road. Just walk. about time.. I got a dirty look from one of the bird riders just because I was crossing the street on the designated crosswalk while they came from the corner  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Cop on a motorcycle was stopping scooter riders on bruinwalk üéâ Scooters shouldn‚Äôt run stop signs, but I would MUCH rather scooters get ticketed for being on the sidewalk, especially when cutting through campus. They still go full speed zipping through heavy pedestrian traffic, and people do get hit and injured. Finally, those fuckers have the audacity to stare at you as if you're responsible for their foolishness üôèüèºüôèüèºpedestrians winning **Awesome.** About time those selfish fucks get their comeuppance. I‚Äôve had too many of these guys zip by me when I try to leave PS7, where you can‚Äôt take a right on red. Makes sense: It‚Äôs a law and it‚Äôs for the safety of people crossing the crosswalk and the cars coming down the hill. But it just makes me so mad when I finally get the green and some fuck blows a red light on the damn scooter, bringing us to a halt because no one wants to run over some fuck on a scooter. The day of reckoning is upon us Seen multiple tickets given out for wearing headphones while driving them in the street. Don‚Äôt do it! I was wondering why UCLA PD was all up and down the hill today. Good thing too! I was almost hit in a crosswalk by a scooter today (I had looked both ways too and stepped off the curb after waiting for a car, this guy literally came out of nowhere!) Glad ucla pd is doing something about it because people who ride those things are truly something else with the not paying attention and thinking they are invincible Poggers natural selection atp. This is why we need designated bike lanes away from cars and pedestrians ;)) I feel you totally as a pedestrian, but also‚Ä¶ How do you feel about someone dismounting their scooter and rolling it along the crosswalk to save time on a red light? I usually do that and I believe it‚Äôs fair but idk. I do agree with this as a scooter rider. If you're going to ride one, obey the law. But I also have something else to add, I've been riding scooters and taking public transit around UCLA for a good bit and I've come to a consensus. UCLA students are bad pedestrians. I am not a bad scooter rider, I obey the law, I ride in the street only unless I'm forced onto the side walk by a bad driver or something and yet I still have almost hit multiple people while riding. You wanna know why? Because y'all be forgetting that streets are fucking streets! UCLA is very foot-traffic heavy but goddamn, if you're going to be mad at us for riding on the sidewalk, watch what the fuck you're doing when you're in the street!! Every single person I have almost hit has been a direct result of them not looking when they cross the street. I get jaywalking is apparently legal out here now but it is still a street with cars and motorized vehicles that can hit you! Please just have a bit more cautiousness when crossing the street without being in the crosswalk, especially in North and South Campus, they may be small streets but it is still the road and that's where everyone is complaining that we're supposed to be. Like I said, completely agree with that, but don't be complaining when you get hit by a car or a scooter because you don't know how to cross the road properly. Just simple swivel of the head BEFORE you step in the road is enough. Thank you. Good - now cars can actually GO when we're pulling up to a stop sign, rather than wait for us to stop at the line because they're afraid we'll blast through. Makes stop signs so annoying as someone who obeys traffic laws - cars that should've been cleared out are just waiting there for me to arrive. Just GO - as if I'm pulling up in a regular vehicle!   Also, OP: your last line says a lot about you. If you can't even respect scooter riders who are obeying laws, then you're just the dickhead. >Also, if you're in the road going 10 mph in the fast lane you bet were going to honk at you until you move over. I get they're convenient but damn you're pests on the sidewalk and pests in the road. Just walk.  Nah. They must follow traffic laws, but as such, drivers must share the road with them Btw, electric skateboards do not have the same rules. They are legally allowed to ride on sidewalks under 15 mph, and yes, that includes bruin plaza's dismount zone good I hate scooters and bikers. They scare me. I saw one blow through a stop sign the other day and almost got hit by car. I was about to be a witness for the driver against the acooter as a scooter rider, i fully approve of this you'll never catch me alive, coppers! aaAAHAHHHHAAHAHAHAHAAA shut up We will fight back against this tyranny Look at mr holier than thou over here I still think it's crazy that helmets aren't required if you're over 18.  It's not like your brain becomes any less important...    UCLA classmate is in a persistent vegetative state after getting hit by a car. Dude was on his way to getting a PhD.  Please wear helmets. I understand people must be frustrated by others on scooters zipping by them. But do you really hope they disappear?  As someone who spends nearly $400 on gas a month and 3 hours in traffic daily, I‚Äôd like to remind you that scooters are green, can get you far, and ‚Äî if the city does its part to maintain bike lanes ‚Äî can clear tons of congestion on the road.   A scooter is a essentially a bike. It should be integrated with the same rules as a bike. No sidewalk, use bike lane if there is one, otherwise use the road. They should obey traffic laws.  This is also a thing in New York: scooters/whatnot are given free reign to run reds. Driving there, I had to be wary. I‚Äôd love riding the Revel electric mopeds there though.   Anyways, I don‚Äôt think the same rules work in LA, which is a sprawling city with no public transport. I think the conversation should be around how we integrate this solution into the LA traffic ecosystem.   I wouldn‚Äôt be happy the police department is wasting their time on enforcing this as a Band-Aid. Either scooters disappear, or they come back with little change after the crackdown. I‚Äôd push LADOT to get their crews painting and creating clear road rules!   Scooters can go like 15 miles/hr. I mentioned I spend a ton of time on the road; I‚Äôd have no issue‚Ä¶ *on a college campus with heavy foot traffic*‚Ä¶ going that speed.  Side note:   You know the UC cops crack down every so often, right? There‚Äôs no panacea on the other side, it‚Äôll just tame the issue a bit.   In my second year, they started cracking down on skaters and Bird scooters on BruinWalk (this is when Birds first got introduced)  I got a $200 ticket for skating and never paid it ‚Äî it got waived. I am pregnant and I can‚Äôt tell you how scared I am trying to cross the street between Young Hall and PS 2, every day because of these damn scooters thinking they are above stopping and nearly running me over‚Ä¶. Finally. I drive to campus and it has happened to me three times already where a person on a scooter blows through a red light and I have to slam on my breaks to not hit them. Then they have the nerve to flip me off?! Will they chase me if I get on campus and pretend to ignore them though? 1. It's funny because the only people riding on sidewalks are ppl who don't ride birds often/not good at it and are scared of the road.  2. Doesn't 2 include 1 and 3?   3. Don't all these rules apply to bikes too? It's funny how this just isn't an issue with bikes because of how lazy humanity has become so you're either scootering or driving, you won't even bike. Hilarious how much society fumes before it grows a pair. so entitled üòÇ yeah literally one of them almost hit me coming down the hill AFTER I had already stopped for a car and checked both ways again. I stepped into the street to start walking in a crosswalk and looked at me like I was the one doing something wrong ü§° [deleted] I've seen several pedestrians hit by scooters running stop signs, luckily so far not with any major injuries. And cars. The amount of times bird riders fly through stop signs as I‚Äôm trying to drive by is too high. And somehow I‚Äôll be at fault anyway because my vehicle is bigger Truthhhh Absolutely, but even then I doubt a good chunk of scooter users will even use them lmao. There's a protected bike line on Strathmore going towards the hill from the Engineering Plaza and I still see scooters on the regular ass road p sure that‚Äôs fine it‚Äôs standard w bikes too. also i think legally you have to dismount and cross to box turn left You‚Äôre right ‚ÄúAccording to the law, a pedestrian must not suddenly leave a curb, sidewalk, or other place of safety to put himself or others at imminent risk. Pedestrians have the right of way at most crossings, including marked and unmarked crosswalks.‚Äù Also if you‚Äôre riding at night make sure your scooter has a light. I‚Äôve seen so many with no lights at night and no one can see them My closest hit while cycling was a pedestrian who, earbuds in, umbrella open, and walking through the rain decided to make a sudden about left off the sidewalk into the road to cross.   I came to a screeching halt inches from her. She neither saw nor heard me. She learned nothing.   Plus √ßa change, plus c'est la m√™me chose. This literally happened to me. I had to be in the fast lane in order to make an upcoming left turn and almost got hit because a prius didn‚Äôt want to share the road with me :‚Äô) im just tryna follow the law buddy i don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true bc i thought normal skateboards were also banned/had the dismount rule apply Yesterday I saw a scooter run a **red** light crossing Gayley. Noise canceling headphones on, no regard for looking at oncoming traffic. Almost got hit twice, got honked at (DUH), flipped the driver off. How many more assholes need to be hit and killed before we can end this nonsense?   Look at this [https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/inside-the-issues/2022/05/13/study--e-scooter-injury-rate-in-la-surpasses-national-rate-for-motorcycles](https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/inside-the-issues/2022/05/13/study--e-scooter-injury-rate-in-la-surpasses-national-rate-for-motorcycles)  and this [https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/e-scooter-injury-rate-los-angeles](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/e-scooter-injury-rate-los-angeles) Lmao, unless you‚Äôre going uphill and the Bird only goes like 12 mph Found someone who doesn't drive Or take the bus/walk. It‚Äôs not worth it Or maybe because most cyclists actually follow the rules of the road and don't have the audacity to ride right through crowds of people on bruinwalk Amazing how people gargle the balls of authority and then clutch pearls at the injustice next week they‚Äôre illegal on bruinwalk i would love to have more designated scooter lanes away from pedestrians and cars. i get terrified riding my scooter because traffic is so hectic im afraid i‚Äôm going to get hit by a car :‚Äô) when the dismount zone was first introduced, it was all bikes, skateboards, and scooters (this was before electric scooters). I was driving home once and there was this group of bicylsts that were going on green but they just kept going went it red we honked and they just flipped us all off. I think honestly people are assholes and i very much disagree with the laws in california as they protect idiots like the scooter u saw and the people i saw and punish the victims which are drivers >Look at this    >   >https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/inside-the-issues/2022/05/13/study--e-scooter-injury-rate-in-la-surpasses-national-rate-for-motorcycles  this is only true because   a. most motorcycle accidents mostly end in deaths, which is not considered an injury  b. there are more scooter riders than motorcyclists in california Let‚Äôs be real. 5mph uphill on a good day Definitely do, beautiful subaru Outback wilderness What‚Äôs wrong with not driving? You‚Äôre cooler for choosing a lifestyle that consumes more fossil fuels, right?  Fuck scooters and cars! They‚Äôre both an inconvenience to me trying to walk.

RA group interviews? Does it really take 1.5h? Also how is it/what do we do during that time? It does take the full time. I would recommend not stressing out too much and just being yourself. They made us swear not to tell anyone the activities though so that‚Äôs probably why there hasn‚Äôt been any talk about it on here. Don‚Äôt worry too much about it though I promise it‚Äôs actually kind of fun. yep it took the whole time! they were really specific on telling us not to share what you do during it tho so just show up lol No bars anywhere :(  bro clean ur screen üò≠üò≠ use data whore HBS major i‚Äôm really interested in the HBS (B.A.) major but i‚Äôm worried i‚Äôm not cut out for the lower div science courses. it‚Äôs just the LS7 series and one quarter of chem, but i haven‚Äôt taken science classes since hs and i never took chemistry. almost everyone ik struggles with LS and chem and they are fully stem people. i am not a stem girly at all but the hbs major sounds really cool. any thoughts on how hard the classes are for non-stem oriented people? Not a stem kid in HS, was always interested in the kinds of ideas focused on in HBS but felt decidedly non-stem & dealt with this same question when I went back to school.   Reality is I aced my classes when I went through the pre reqs (ee bio, BS), because I cared enough to give it time and attention. It‚Äôs hard for sure. It will take effort but if you‚Äôre willing to put in the work you can absolutely get through it, and will likely surprise yourself. Don‚Äôt buy into the separation of stem as some skill set you either have or don‚Äôt!!! False binary! Graduated in Spring of 2022 with B.S. in HBS! Really loved the upper div HBS courses and if you think you will too it's worth it to do the LS 7 series and Chem course. I didn't think I was cut out for science at UCLA too and started off as an Econ major before finding HBS but I'd say even tho LS7 series can be tough at times, it is designed to be approachable regardless of previous science experience and I truly think if you dedicate enough time to it you can succeed also (but I will say it may be slightly easier if you have taken some HS bio). Additionally, the LS7 courses are more problem solving than route memorization so I honestly don't think prior science experience makes that much of a difference. With all these courses I would do research on BruinWalk to try to take it with the best professor possible as experience can vary based on who who take the classes with. LS7 is the worst series on campus but if u have to do it you kind of just suck it up Math 156 closed by department?? My enrollment is RN and I need it you can call the math department to check but same thing happened to me for math 70 which sucks bc it‚Äôs my major req and only offered spring. they said it‚Äôs likely because they couldn‚Äôt find an instructor in time and just to keep an eye out if the class opens again. they also said a few other math classes had this issue so yours might be one of them. I think I speak for everyone when I say the math department is the best department in the school üòçüòçüòç so beautifully managed and free of bureaucratic crap ü•∞ Same with math 182 :( One of my classes was closed. I asked the math department yesterday and apparently they're working out the schedules for a lot of classes, and you should plan alternatives for now. You can potentially petition to take CS M146 instead, and you may be able to contact the prof to get you a PTE if you don‚Äôt have the CS pre reqs, though there isn‚Äôt many. FUCK I NEED THIS TO GRADUATE FUCK bro same. i need math 70 too and my schedule got f‚Äôd up now But if I literally need this to graduate what should I do?? My only other req left is a GE which I‚Äôve already enrolled in. I‚Äôm working this summer and can‚Äôt take a summer class, especially one as involved as math 156. Wait for them to reschedule it is all you can do. I said this the counselor yesterday and they basically were just like, \"just wait lol\". UCLA Wants You To Help Them Find Extraterrestrial Life  Thoughts on Math 184? Please let me know your experiences! I am considering taking this course next quarter. Took this with Igor Pak and it was one of the hardest undergrad math courses I've taken. Pak expects you to keep up with his speed as he's brilliant. He's your stereotypical tough love Russian math professor that's also famous in his field of combinatorics and he went to Harvard for his PhD. If you want an easy class or an easy A, don't take this. The homeworks, midterm, and final were very tough. I learned a lot though. If you're really interested in combinatorics and up for a challenge, I'd recommend taking this.

Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è My understanding is that Centennial and Olympic are the only ones that are more expensive. They're supposed to be nicer, slightly larger, and they have bathrooms on both wings of the floor but honestly it's not worth it and I enjoyed living in Holly more. [deleted] Thank you :D Huh.

How Early to Line Up For Stanford Basketball Game?  RA group interviews how did you guys feel about it ü´£ü´£ i had it and am so confused whether i did ‚Äúgood‚Äù or not like what did they want i felt like everyone in my group would‚Äôve made good ras üò≠ literally i feel the same üíÄ Are we hearing back tomorrow??? not sure Anyone else not really care about grades? I mean, I put work into class and stuff, but a lot of people I know stress out about getting straight As in all their classes and for all their tests.   But like.. I don‚Äôt have that same drive and I feel like I should because that‚Äôs how other people act? But to me if I get a B, I get a b. If I get a C, the world goes on and knowing 70% of the information is an achievement to me I guess?  I went to a very non competitive high school and grew up with this mindset so maybe some of y‚Äôall are just built different. Depends on your goal, I dont plan on getting higher degree or anything so Idc, but if you are planning for med school, grad, phd. You better be caring about your grades lmao. Lmfao I stressed the fuck about As in high school but now I‚Äôm like you I went to a very competitive high school but I never actually cared about grades that much, and I really just half assed things so I didn‚Äôt fail for my parents. It just hurts kind of when my friends all had way better UW GPAs than me because they took easier classes or they worked hard, and they assumed I had the same or even better grades and test scores. I just have a habit of trying to get at least a B by aiming for an A but I also hate it when I put in work for an A and get less than that twin ü§ûüèª Same, I do as much work as I can to still enjoy my life and chill. I aim for As in the classes I can get them, and I‚Äôm fine with Bs if it means not overexerting myself. I felt this in my soul. I used to stress so much about my grades and getting straight As but at some point I realized that it‚Äôs not worth the stress. I still care about my grades and do my best but I don‚Äôt agonize over my assignments or tests anymore.   I think on a bigger level I just realized that we are going to end up where we will and the only thing that really matters is being happy. I know that sounds cliche but stressing definitely does not make me happy and why stress over something that is going to have the same end whether you stressed about it or not  I dont know if this made sense but really my point is: be happy, you are amazing, you are worthy of your goals, and enjoy the things you do! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú® That‚Äôs how I think too. I study hard, get a b, no regrets. I already worked so hard I shouldn‚Äôt blame myself and the course materials are pretty interesting. Also if you enjoy the materials you will get good grades. Same saaaaame! hearing people complain about b's and c's is shocking to me. a dub is a dub idc. also didn't go to a competitive high school and my mindset is totally work smarter, not harder. Your comment karma is insane, but yeah I get how you feel nah im the same, it doesn't really matter. nice to know im not the only person that thinks this way. This is a very good and healthy attitude to have, as long as you're doing well overall Depends on your post graduation goals. Me. D minuses get degrees lmao [deleted] I‚Äôm the same. I don‚Äôt really care as much about grades. As long as I‚Äôm passing, that‚Äôs good. I have a 3.7 gpa right now and haven‚Äôt been stressed out over any of my assignments. If I try too hard, I‚Äôll start stressing. I suffer with mental health so I‚Äôd rather take care of myself first I think that depends. I‚Äôm in computer science, and to me it seems that they tend to care more about work or research experience more than your grades. Obviously that can vary wildly from field to field and even professor to professor, but I think if you have something else going for you you don‚Äôt always need particularly stellar grades. What career are you doing after undergrad if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? Same Dude that is so uncalled for. GPA just does not matter for most people, especially after a few years out of college. Lab tech or something of the sort. Letters and Science Majors? Hey! I‚Äôm a first year English major but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll stick with it LOL. I‚Äôm just super curious about the marine biology major right now. If there are any marine biology majors here‚Ä¶ How have classes been for this major? What are your thoughts on your major? Do you like it so far?   In general anyone else in the Letters and Science department? I‚Äôm thinking of switching majors so I‚Äôm curious about the other majors in that departmentüòÖ Any majors in that department feel free to comment on your experiences and what you like/dislike!   I‚Äôm really still exploring as I feel like i am still not fully decided on my English major. My plan is to work in education as a teacher if I do pursue my English major since helping other kids succeed and writing is something that I like to also do. Anyways, thanks guys! Marine biology classes are honestly really rough, they‚Äôre mostly taken over by weeder classes like chem 14 series, life sci 30 series, all pretty hard classes that destroy your psyche. I switched from it to anthropology cause it was just such a stressful degree plan, and waaay too broad.  But it depends, what do u wanna do with the degree? If you‚Äôre going into the more analytical parts of marine bio like computing, statistics, stuff like that, then it‚Äôs probably more worth it. Why do so many professors for summer courses not have bruinwalk scores 90 percent of all the poli sci professors who are teaching summer classes do not have bruin walk scores and I have 0 idea if they are good or bad professors. Bc a lot of summer courses are taught by graduate students who mostly just TA during the normal school year I think some of them are phd students. Never took summer classes, but sometimes it‚Äôs Russian roulette and I usually just go to the first class to see if they‚Äôre cool or not. Last spring the no bruinwalk reviews prof teaching mgmt 130a said he only counted higher of midterm and final and there was some grade inflation since a lot of people got A‚Äôs so that was a fun class. Probably hard to do for summer though There‚Äôs lecturers from other schools in summer as well. It‚Äôs not your main tenured ucla profskies. Powell cat is known to be especially active during the Summer months though. any psych majors wanna hold a class for me please!!!  In need of real academic advising So i recently bombed a midterm for a course I need for my major requirements. Do I do a P/NP even though it then wont count towards the major requirement or should I just drop the course now and get out. How does the grading work in the class? If it's in engineering and you aren't too many standard deviations below average things should turn out okay on paper You in ECE 113? Powell Loaf  Math 33a with Shin? has anyone taken his class? How is it ? Thanks How important is graduation? Hi, I know the title sounds crazy BUT hear me out. I want to study abroad this summer as a senior and will be able to but the problem is I can only attend the general graduation ceremony. Does anyone think the major specific or ethnic related ceremonies are worth it? I would appreciate any feedback! I think you should just do whatever you want or is convenient for you. For me, graduation is like a participation award but it may be more meaningful to others well kanye made it Don‚Äôt sweat it, study abroad Any electrical engineering students interested in a study group?  how does swiping ppl in at dining halls work? can i swipe other ppl in without swiping in myself? if you get a food truck ticket at a front desk, you can give that ticket to someone and they can use it to get in Depends on the person swiping cards, but I've definitely seen them let people swipe others in but not the card holder, as long as it's your Bruin card. No, you can‚Äôt. You have to accompany anyone you swipe in found a missing wallet I found a missing wallet around the Wilshire center bus stop. Where would I return this to?

You can always get ear plugs if it bothers you that much can someone hold a class for me need econ 1 held by someone with an early first pass.. will pay good :) dm me!! To my friend of six months, how do I tell her that I like her/ask her on a date?  before you do anything you should consider her feelings. has she given you any signs of liking you back? If you wanna be with her telling her you like her is not the way to go, if anything show her you like her. Be flirty and make physical contact then see how she responds, if she reciprocates then tell her you wanna take her out and then make the date an experience for her, if she doesn‚Äôt reciprocate then she‚Äôs not down at which point you do NOT keep trying, you go find someone else you like. Usually if you go this long without making a move they will think of you as a friend since you haven‚Äôt given her any good reason not to so just be aware of that. There‚Äôs a good chance she already knows you like her as a girl, i feel like you should just tell her. there is nothing worse than finding out the guy you liked had a crush on you for months but never told you. i've been on both sides of the situation, where a guy friend told me he liked me & i didn't reciprocate feelings & where he told me he liked me & i shared those feelings.   in the situation where i didn't feel the same way, we just kept being friends. things were awkward for a few days, but everything went back to normal once we decided it was best he wouldn't pursue things w/ me because i didn't feel the same way.   in the other situation where i did like him back, we tested things out to see if we would be romantically compatible. we messed around for a few months but eventually decided we'd just be better off as friends, and we're still friends to this day.   if you don't want it to be awkward, don't make it awkward. i know, easier said than done, but i will always, always, always preach straightforward communication. guessing games are stressful for everyone. reading the \"signs\" is not always as effective as you think-- i've had guys be super touchy/feely w/ me & end up friend-zoning me.   be honest w/ her about your feelings! who knows, something great could come out of it (: She‚Äôs not your friend if you‚Äôve just been waiting on the sidelines for a chance. Be honest with yourself, shoot your shot, and if it doesn‚Äôt work out who cares there 10,000 other girls at ucla Tell her how you feel (or else you'll just regret it and eat yourself up), but be prepared for the event that she doesn't feel the same way. Just ask her if you can take her to Mcdonals or something. if she says no go bang one of her friends. You in the friend zone bruh. Cut your losses ‚Ä¶ Grow a pair and tell her You have to let her know how you feel and tell her that you want to be more than friends. She‚Äôll respect you 10x if you do this because rn she has you by the balls homie. If you let her dictate what you guys are, then she has all the power in the relationship. You need to switch the power dynamic back to you my guy, unless of course, you want to stay friends I think so. She‚Äôs made a point of going to lunch and coffee at times and asked me to go to clubs with her. We get along quite well, but it‚Äôs still hard to know if she actually likes me like that or just sees me as a really good friend. A lot of people here are saying you need to have airtight proof she could be into you romantically before you ask her out‚Ä¶ I think that‚Äôs really dumb. 1) You‚Äôre asking if you can take her out on date, not if you can kiss her. 2) Its nearly impossible with most girls to know for certain whether they‚Äôre into you or not.   Ideally you‚Äôre going to need to be upfront with her and say ‚Äúhey, I feel this way about you, not sure if you feel the same way. But I want to give this a chance. Can I take you to lunch/dinner sometime?‚Äù And if she says no, say you‚Äôll drop it and continue to be friends.  This is literally the most innocent and normal thing ever and I‚Äôm confused why people are acting like this is the friendship-equivalent of deciding to drop a nuclear bomb. What if I don‚Äôt completely like her yet but just interested? Coming from someone with negative social skills. I didn‚Äôt start hanging out with friends on my own (outside of school) until sophomore year of college. I‚Äôm not even familiar with the whole friend zone vs romantic dynamic.  I had some guys tell me to straight up bring her a bouquet of flowers on valentines but I don‚Äôt even know her enough to be a friend. Idk if that‚Äôs good advice, they seemed serious about it. Solid advice Mr. feces W To play devil's advocate, I feel that lunch and coffee are more of reserved for friends and not necessarily indicative of romantic interest. If she asked you out for dinner or something, I think that maybe something was up!   My boyfriend and I were kind of in a similar situation but hey we're together now :) Maybe you can ask her out for dinner some place like decently nice (Prince of Venice hella cute and mid-range). Just say something like \"Oh I heard there's this restaurant in Westwood that's really good, do you want to go for dinner there together sometime?\" Check during your kind of date for signs and go from there I guess!  I think the best way to tell if a girl is interested in you is if she puts in special effort to her appearance if it's a \"just the two of you\" occasion :) Maybe put on a nice button-up for some Prince of Venice or offer to pay and see how she responds! I heavily recommend the Pasta Al Limone there (SOOO GOOD) but you can't really go wrong with any of their pastas and pizzas (not sponsored). Best of luck OP give us an update! i think it‚Äôs really important to make sure she feels the same before you do anything. coming from a girl, it‚Äôs the worst thing ever when a guy you thought you can genuinely (finally) be friends with makes a confession out of no where. does she tease you? texts you out of no where? makes an effort to somehow unintentionally but intentionally touch you (bump into you, sit close to you, maybe hit you when she laughs)? those can all be signs that she feels the same way i feel like struggling w/ the friend zone & figuring out the romantic dynamic is universal! it's not a skill that can just be learned, since every relationship is so different.   if you don't completely like her yet but are just interested, i'd wait it out to see how your feelings develop over time. it would suck to think you're interested, express that, have her fall for you, and then you pull back-- she would probably be hurt by this. i would wait until you know if you want something more than a friendship & then tell her.   if you're curious about what a relationship with her might look like, try being a little flirty & see how she responds. i wouldn't suggest the bouquet of flowers thing-- that seems like a bit much & i would be intimidated by that! Jesus christ This. A girl making an effort to look extra good for you is a huge sign. Other signs too ofc but this is a big one. Thank you for this input. It‚Äôs still kinda hard to know is why it‚Äôs difficult. I feel like there are good signs but nothing that is overtly obvious to say that she definitely feels the same way. Honestly, you're kind of asking him to read her mind. It can be really, really difficult for guys to evaluate that objectively. few worlds exists where your guy friend doesn't want to fuck you   yall stay wastin everyones time this To add to this, if you ask her, be prepared to lose her as a friend, in case she doesn't like you back that way.. maybe don‚Äôt confess anything but just ask her to go out with you somewhere and then feel it out from there nope, not asking him to read minds, just asking him to read the signs first No reward without risk, this is the main thing to consider There are many ways to do this without losing her as a friend if she doesn't want a relationship lol This is probably the best thing. Low pressure and low risk of losing her as a friend but at least it shows heavy interest on my part without revealing my feelings You're asking him to be correct about it.  You can try to 'read the signs' as a guy, but there is no 'making sure' without actually asking. That would be mind reading. I think you seriously underestimate the difficulty of this for inexperienced guys. Sure, most people know the signs, but some girls actually do stuff like this without being aware of it. All of my female friends are in different places along their attention to the \"signs\". Some of them give a lot of casual physical contact, some of them are enthusiastic about your jokes, some of them bump into you a lot, but overall we know we're just friends. Not everyone speaks the same language; you have to be careful and know the person more deeply.  For one, my girlfriend had absolutely no perception of standard \"signals.\" But things worked out regardless. Not every hug, forced high-five, fancy dress, is a signal for certain women... however I do think openness to, even enthusiasm for meeting is a big deal. There is a frikkin reward, he gets to be friends with this awesome person..  But tbh, if OP feels like he'd regret it forever if he never asked her, then he should do it. Nah it's just... it can get awkward, depending on the person well i meant don‚Äôt go into this completely blindly. for me, i‚Äôd rather a confession feel right than for it to feel like a shot in the dark. if the signs aren‚Äôt clear enough and he still wants an answer, he should go for it! but be prepared to potentially lose a friend. it might be a good learning experience as well Easy Biology upper div classes I need one last upper div, any recommendations? EEB 129 super super easy  1 research project  1 super easy midterm  1 final 109L is the easiest and the most fun in my opinion. 142 is also a great course offered. Thanks!! Just enrolled in both, thanks! Love your username too! Yeah no worries I hope you enjoy them! Forever a barbz :) Does anyone know when the c/o 2023 graduation sash will become available?  study abroad fall semester im just wondering how this usually works is it longer? also would i be able to come back and take classes winter and spring quarter? Depends on the academic calendar of your abroad university, but usually they start early so you get a shorter summer break Flatbread bplate server is my homie The guy who works the flatbread station at bplate is a legend! Every time I pull up he asks me if I want 3. My actual bulk mentorüôè [removed] ong so true Same here!! He always gives me at least two and then asks if I want more lol. Sweetest guy :) Flatbread, chicken, steak, rly any kinda meat they have. Bplate brown rice is mad underrated. Then some bread and yogurt He deserves an award ü§© [removed] Since they switched to chicken thighs this quarter I think they taste better than study meat. Flatbread is similar in terms of macros ig. Red meat is almost always steak, gets kinda boring imo what‚Äôs a good rsu time? my time is early on the 6th earliest is 3/6 8am Females who want a 4bd/4ppl and have an RSU time before 9 I already have a group and we want a 4/4 but our RSU time is late. We would love to join your rsu group. Joining would not change who‚Äôs in your unit or your ability to get a room. Our groups can be in different units but it just has to be within the same apartment. I did this last year so if you have any questions lmk.   I‚Äôm willing to hold a class for you (bio major; my first enrollment opens 2/17 at 8am) or buy you lunch or pay. I'm in the same boat! want the same but have shit time. if anyone else would be willing to let us join an early time i am a great neighbor and will consistently share homemade baked goods :)) Should I first pass LS7A or Math 31B next quarter? Thank you!!! Hi! I'm not sure if this is entirely accurate, but I used this [website](https://stack.dailybruin.com/2020/02/05/class-fill-ups/). According to it, both LS7A and Math 31B didn't have their seats filled. However, I wouldn't 100% believe my word since unexpected things can happen. Thank you so so so much!!!! Art History 31 with Hall Has anyone taken this class with Professor Hall, if so, how was it? Tysm!! I couldn‚Äôt find anything about this class with Professor Hall on Bruinwalk üò≠ If the professor‚Äôs first name is Rebecca, I took the class last winter qtr !! Content was pretty easy, just memorization and assignments were not bad either. I believe we only had 4 assignments but your lowest was dropped. Exams were open response and lowkey took a while, but as long as you have a general idea of the content you‚Äôll be fine. Big emphasis on religious art and just memorization ! I got an A+, hopefully this helps Omg thank u so so much!!! It says Hall, R. on the website so im guessing R stands for Rebecca. Also may I ask if u had to write papers? Thank you!!! Yeah I believe one of the assignments was to write a visual analysis paper, but it wasn‚Äôt too bad. Again though is it a bit of memorization and I feel that you have to find the content somewhat interesting in order to do well. It‚Äôs a good GE though!! Got it! Thank u so so so much!!!!

Why Are Food Trucks Normal Hours Again üò≠ Saw that the food trucks are back to being 11-3, 5-9 like whyyy. it was nice to have eating options on the hill in between those times :( fr üíîüíîüíî i think they weren‚Äôt making enough money on the new hours :,) if food trucks actually get $9 per ticket, their margins are insane [removed] but i felt like the lines were always long? at least they were for the sproul trucks :( I doubt they do tbh Whole UCLA Dining setup is a Scam when you think about it. dude why is this actually so facts. If you want a solid, satisfying meal using one food truck ticket you AREN'T going to get it on top of waiting like 45 minutes. Not worth it at all. I pretty much only go if I have any leftover swipes That‚Äôs why you go into the dining hall and try to eat for 10 people every time. You gotta be the ones to scam them Freshman 150 üò≠ Best ling upper divs? What are the best/easiest/most interesting upper div ling courses people have taken? 170 w daria! super interesting, esp if u like the more humanities-based parts of ling, super easy grading and great prof thanks for the rec! This quarter has been fucking hell. I‚Äôm not going to unload what I‚Äôm dealing with on here cause it would be a massive rant but I went through a lot in a month. It‚Äôs getting better for me but I went through so much shit- I‚Äôm so thankful to my professors and TAs for being so understanding of extensions. I still cannot catch a break though. Ughh I‚Äôm going to be better at avoiding toxic people. That‚Äôs all I will say. Winter quarter things Fr after this quarter we should freshen it up and go on strike or sum Same here, been withdrawing from fentanyl last week. Absolutely brutal.. To OP, things always seem to work out in the long run. Lots of good places on campus to get lost and avoid the chaos if other folks are what is getting you down.  Good luck ! [deleted] [removed] My lowest point mentally and academically is winter quarter the sooner it‚Äôs over the better > withdrawing from fentanyl   How did you start w/ fentanyl? Was it for a medical reason? this is the most annoying reply to ever exist lmfao [removed] Pretty sure that was sarcasm lol [removed] [removed] What are your go-to restaurants near campus in Westwood?  always had a soft spot for mr noodle tbh but gushi and bella pita are def up there too When House of Meatballs first opened, it was amazing. Still a nice Italian restaurant, but I really miss their Special Ball of the Week. kazunori mr noodle ‚ù§Ô∏è Northern Cafe Chinese hot pot,in n out Nick the Greek Ami Sushi ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è House of Meatballs is a great place. Sometimes miss the old interior design but it is very nice still and the outdoor seating they have isn‚Äôt bad at all.  I think Enzo‚Äôs is actually nice to eat inside of too. Both places are nice Italian options imo. Falafel inc I have tried most. Ami has good portion sizes of sushi for the price, loooove it. Enzo's pizza is also a go to, its just so good and cozy inside. Kazunori is really delicious but overpriced for the amount of food, I still go there sometimes a treat. Mr. noodle is a go to as well. Idk, I've eaten most food in Westwood but the asian foods are the best so that's why I listed those mostly. Falafel inc has a bussin shawarma sandwich When 99 ranch market opens it will be awesome. Used to be kohls MR RICE ! Ami and Hibachi Papi when I wanna treat myself. Gushi. Bella Pita. In-n-Out. Mr.Noodle OBVIOUSLY. Then gogobop! DELICIOUS. Elysee Bakery & Cafe. So good! the french way Plateia!! It‚Äôs in the Luskin Conference Center california pizza kitchen Bollywood Bites and Hangry Moon are my favs Tender Greens, love their salads Maharaj is the only local buffet I know of. I really recommend trying the Brazilian restaurant in farmers market (grove). You pay by weight and the food is incredible. Lamonica‚Äôs NY Pizza Dennys, duhhhh I reallly like hangry moons Pinches tacos I like lazy daisy cafe! tulsi absolutely The French Way!! French tacos are the best Northern Cafe Noodle House! Their lamb skewers go hard bella pita >>> open late and pretty affordable considering how much food you get i second this. their ravioli>>> I went once and the meatballs I had were so dry they were hard to swallow. It was really disappointing. The flavor was probably fine but it was hard to tell. ‚Äúspecial ball of the week‚Äù is killing me, what a name üò≠ Omg yes Nick the Greek slaps yes After a long day i cant bring myself to eat food that relies on an industry that brutally murders animals What‚Äôre the prices like there and do they have burritos?

LS23L, LS7C or Chem 14a There is only one chem 14a and one LS23L course being offered so i feel like i should use it on those, but I don‚Äôt want to be stuck with an awful professor/lecture time for 7C. Has anyone ever taken EE BIOL 185 Evolutionary Medicine with Lozano-Huntelman? There seems to be no reviews for this professor and I want to know what this class was like or generally if you recommend the professor/class? TIA. im taking 120 w her and the class is not that great bc she doesn‚Äôt record and she talks sooooo fast and doesn‚Äôt post her slides!!!!!! idk about the class itself but I‚Äôm taking 7b with Lozano-Huntelman rn and she‚Äôs just meh. she kinda makes me feel like i‚Äôm back in high school w how she treats us I hate it when they dont post slides ugh Oh okay thank you! Can you please specify what you mean by that? idk just the way she lectures and talks. we have these weekly ‚Äúhandouts‚Äù that are not required or anything, they‚Äôre just optional so we can get an understanding of the material. The other day she hovered over me until i opened it and started working on it. mind you there‚Äôs about 400 other people in this class so idk why she did that to me specifically Finding an apartment for just summer C session Where is the best place to look for people subletting their apartment over the summer.

Lost airpod pro 2 case If you lost your airpod pro 2 case on veteran, send me a dm with a description of them so I can return them Duo Security Why is Duo Security necessary I swear logging into bruinlearn is such a pain in the ass for no reason üò≠üò≠ 2FA makes it harder for someone to hack into your account.. they'd have to have your password and your physical phone. fr like.. the way the verification code is sent to my phone doesn‚Äôt bring up the auto fill prompt like other 2 factor authentication services do If you have a MacBook with touch ID, you can use touch ID instead of phone verification. I set it up a while ago so I don't remember the exact steps but I think next time you get a duo push popup on your macbook, click \"other options\" or \"manage devices\" or something to set it up Duo notification on Apple Watch is pretty slick Hypothetically someone could do some serious damage if they hacked your student account.  I don‚Äôt mind duo security for that reason You can just download the app and all you have to do is tap a button saw that people were having issues with the app and getting locked out so i opted for the text option. Ahh I wouldn‚Äôt mind duo so much if the auto fill prompt worked properly! It does for everything else on my iPhone but never for the texts that duo sends. Stats 13 or LS40 which one is better/easier i took ls40 and it was very easy. there is ‚Äúmore coding‚Äù but honestly i copied and pasted my code from the labs and just changed parameters every time i had to use it. the conceptual stuff isnt bad.   dr shevtsov has bad bruinwalk reviews, but if she is a professor for it next quarter dont be scared. the people who rated her poorly were either upset about the delay in grading (not her fault) or simply didnt properly study for the exams. i took the class with her. i attended all of the classes/labs and one of her weekly office hrs and ended with an A+. i honestly didn‚Äôt do much studying aside from this, so it‚Äôs totally doable.   best of luck! in ls40 rn, it's more conceptual and more coding but we don't have a lot of graded things: it's just clickers, homework, and exams. definitely depends on your strong suit -- if you can understand more conceptual things as opposed to doing pure math then ls40 but if not then stats13.   general rule of thumb just go for stats13 and if you can't get in (it fills up) you can definitely survive ls40.     also if you're in ls30 you understand how annoying kr**** can be to work with so if she gets on your nerves ls40 is not the way to go. difficulty wise they should be similar, ls40 has a lot more coding got it, that was actually a significant concern for me because only Shevstov is teaching next quarter. Stats 13 has Zanotion who has very good reviews though. It's reassuring to know that Shevstov isn't that bad as people say but would you still recommend going for stats 13 if possible? if you‚Äôre not fond of coding, go for stats 13. if you‚Äôre good at coding (or even just okay) i would prioritize them equally and just choose whichever fits best with your schedule :) and if you have any other questions ab ls40 w shevstov feel free to dm me! gotcha, thanks for all the help! is it just me or are there a lot more sketchy people in Ackerman lately? I understand that ucla hosts a lot of conferences and stuff so there are some non-students with badges eating in Ackerman. But I‚Äôve seen a lot more homeless looking people (people with carts/bags full of belongings) sitting in here this week when I usually don‚Äôt see any. What‚Äôs up with that? I‚Äôm not trying to be mean I just thing with the state of the world having non-students who are not affiliated with UCLA inside a college campus doesn‚Äôt seem super safe, even if it is an open campus. Public restrooms, cheap food, shelter from weather, free water, and safety compared to being harassed out in the street. It‚Äôs pretty darn cold outside. Some people need warmth. UCLA is public property at the end of the day As long as they‚Äôre not hurting anyone and don‚Äôt reek, who cares? Lol I have a cart that I take with me to pick up packages in Westwood. Does that mean I‚Äôm homeless and sketchy? just because people are homeless does not mean they‚Äôre automatically dangerous, it‚Äôs not completely unreasonable you feel unsafe cus of stigma but honestly as long as they don‚Äôt bother you what is it to you Looking for Roommates UAH Hello!!!! I'm (female) currently looking for roommates for the next school year, preferably would like to live in a 2b/4ppl in UAH.  I am a rising 4th year studying Political Science and English, I''m Latina, so if there's other Hispanic's looking for roommates message please! Or in general, I'm not looking for all hispanic  roommates ahahaha. messaged you! Can I take a class with the same course number I have taken poli Sci 119 pre modern East Asian political theory. Now I want to take poli Sci 119 Modern political theory. Can I take the class even if the course number is the exact same? Yes as long as the titles are different, you can take the course infinitely Thanks for the info Chem 103 w/ Gimzewski Has anyone taken chem 103 with Gimzewski recently? Does he record lectures and is attendance mandatory? thanks It‚Äôs the easiest Chem class I‚Äôve taken, if not one of the easiest classes at UCLA. He lectured over zoom and recorded everything, but I didn‚Äôt watch a single one. Don‚Äôt bother going or even watching the recording because he just reads off the slides. Now I would definitely suggest going to discussion section as the TA provides important information that will be on the take home midterm and final. Those both took me quite a while to do but they were quite easy. The only homework assignments are weekly blog posts about a given environmental issue, iirc 500-700 words. Super easy class, quite boring though. Chem 113a w/ Barr Has anyone taken chem 113a with Barr? How hard was the class? Is attendance mandatory? thanks XFL Preseason Quarterback Rankings: 5. Brett Hundley Vegas Vipers  It should not be this fucking hard to find somewhere to sit on campus with an outlet  That‚Äôs why I crash lectures at large lecture halls :D not ratting out my current spot, but in the past Haines 39 have outlets on either side in the middle, and health science center third floor first classroom by the D elevator has outlets beside every other seat  Or just walk 10 min inside Powell to find an empty spot XD Just having this exact thought‚Äî found myself sitting down near to a janitor who was vacuuming for a precious outlet Just go into an empty classroom. Worst they can do is tell you to leave just get a portable charger it‚Äôs clutch most libraries I found a bunch in the downstairs research center at Powell today. It's ridiculous that classrooms haven't been retrofitted to accommodate the obvious increased use of technology. Ey be careful some of those utility outlets can be higher voltage.  Double check to be sure you don‚Äôt blow up your stuff I agree completely ASL 3 hi i‚Äôm a bio major wondering if ASL 3 fulfills the language requirement of one year. if so, do we have to take a placement exam? Need advice please! Hi everyone, This is kind of embarrassing because I am a little older and as an adult and I think I should probably know how to take a test at this point, but clearly I need some extra help! I study incredibly hard and I think I really understand the material but under pressure I forget everything and I just overall perform terribly during tests. It‚Äôs been this way since I can remember, I just thought I would grow out of it. Anyways, since my time at UCLA I have realized that grades heavily depend on one if not two exams and that puts me in an unfortunate position being the nervous tester that I am. Does anyone out there have any recommendations on resources that talk about test taking or programs? I looked online and there is an overwhelming amount of stuff on test taking but I wanted to ask here before I go reading everything on the internet. At this point, I really want to drop out but my daughter is my main inspiration to keep going so I don‚Äôt want to give up yet. I‚Äôd like to try to fix this test taking issue I have. Any advice would be so greatly appreciated!! Side note: forgive any grammatical errors, etc. I wrote this quickly. You could always go to the CAE office and see if you could get exam accommodations! I have them due to my adhd and basically when you have an exam you take it in a smaller room with a few others. It helps me focus better and it might help with your jitters if you aren‚Äôt in this huge classroom setting Make sure your stomach is full and that you haven't had any caffeine the day of. Some people take anti-anxiety medication, some people do breathing exercises, some people have a drink or two, but just remember at the end of the day that everything will be alright. look into therapy for anxiety, they even have medication specifically for performance anxiety i have even seen some people be able to bring a notecard of info with them, though I‚Äôm not sure if that was up to the CAE or professor Do u recommend taking CS32 during the summer w/ Ambrosio  Took it with him last summer, was harder than expected. I don‚Äôt personally recommend it unless you want to switch to something CS because CS 32 isn‚Äôt offered in the fall. He is a decent professor. I was an LA over the summer  for CS32 a few years ago. RSU Single Pod (female) Hi! I'm looking to find roommates for a single pod plaza. first pass: LS 23L or CHEM 14D? so i have a pretty good enrollment time and i need to take physics 5C, ls 23L and chem 14D next quarter. physics 5C obv has to go first but any recommendations for LS 23L or chem 14D? idk which fills up faster! thanks! You should first pass 23L labs always fill up fast in first pass. I know there are still spots in second pass 14D this quarter and people drop this class a lot Pretty safe to say that abolishing UCPD would be a terrible idea given the recent Michigan State shooting  When I was at UCLA, I studied abroad at a university in Europe that was about the same size as UCLA.  They had one part-time security guy (unarmed) who would roam around during peak hours.  That was it.  If anything major happened and the local police had to come to campus, it would make the news.    I remember thinking to myself that these people would be shocked to learn that US universities have their own police departments. UCPD does an amazing job and responds to campus incidents incredibly quickly.  I definitely feel much better having them already on campus versus waiting for police to respond from an off-campus station.  There is also a much greater familiarity with campus from UCPD as they are here everyday and truly know campus.  Glad to have them. Michigan cops didn‚Äôt make contact with the shooter until AFTER he committed suicide. It took them 4 hours to find him, he was on foot for 4 hours walking to his house. The cops did nothing to ensure the safety of students. As a first year in the dorms I was detained for a suspicious odor (supposedly coming from my room) as I tried to leave to go to Wooden to workout, by an enthusiastic (I think trainee?) UCPD officer on patrol. He radioed for backup. Who in turn radioed career residential building staff. It became quite the crowd outside my room.   They interviewed me. Then very briefly interviewed my neighbors who answered the door obviously high with red eyes, smelling of weed, and frantically cooking popcorn in a microwave. Quickly decided I was the suspicious one because my window was open and returned to me. I didn‚Äôt want to get my neighbors in trouble so I didn‚Äôt state the obvious. UCPD and UCLA housing then wrote up a false report including notes that I was cooking popcorn in a (imaginary) microwave (that didn‚Äôt exist) in my room.   I then had to go do the standard housing violation meeting with one of the UCLA supervisors. After he promised that he wouldn‚Äôt pursue anyone else if I told him what happened the meeting turned into me explaining in exhaustive detail what complete morons they all were. And that I‚Äôd missed the Wooden closing time.   I had a hard time taking UCPD (and UC housing staff) seriously after that. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre hiring the brightest minds from the engineering and med schools. Or make it harder for people to get guns and kill people The vast majority of universities got their own police in the 60s and 70s as a response to Vietnam and civil rights protests. Their true purpose is to crackdown on student protests before they get too big, just look at UC Davis in 2011. They also serve to hide campus sexual assaults since they don't have to share the info with say LAPD and it keeps the stats low. I know that defund the police has been a topic for years, but has this specific removal of the UCPD a topic too? I‚Äôve always been confused by the abolish UCPD argument.  Most ‚Äúabolish the police‚Äù arguments advocate for replacing city-wide police with smaller-scale, community-oriented law enforcement‚Ä¶ which is exactly what UCPD is.   If we abolished UCPD, we‚Äôd just be left with the LAPD. Setting aside the larger defund argument - having a specialized police force for a specific population is very helpful in my opinion.  No offense to anyone here but college students, affiliates, and faculty are a very difficult community to deal with.  We all may think that we are the salt of the earth but in actuality it's exactly the opposite.  There are few things on this planet more entitled and obnoxious than a 20-year-old unemployed high-achiever, a graduate student, or a professor.  I can guarantee you that a regular police officer would rather be anywhere else on the planet than a college campus.  That being said, UCPD is mostly made up of officers who want to be on a college campus and are specifically trained to be here. Poor logic.  Did the cops prevent this?  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_UCLA_shooting The only time I‚Äôve had to call ucpd they were less than useless Presence of police doesn‚Äôt necessarily make a community safer & it has detrimental effects on high schools that rely on police for campus security. [removed] Agree. the worst case is better than nothing. Was in a lecture when a shooting happened at UCLA. Can‚Äôt imagine how stressed I‚Äôd be if there wasn‚Äôt a UCPD to confront and isolate the shooter. Who has proposed abolishing UCPD? sir what makes you think UCPD is gonna save your ass  https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2022-05-27/uvalde-buffalo-shootings-expose-the-myth-of-the-good-guy-with-a-gun This is California. You think anyone here has any good ideas? ??? UCPD is worse than useless. People just lack common sense. You‚Äôd expect ucla students to use some logical reasoning at the very least. More police is the only correct answer. Tough luck to all you crazy leftists No Less than 1/3 of mass shootings end by police intervention, found this interesting: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/22/us/shootings-police-response-uvalde-buffalo.html I'm a Michigan State student too, and it was an absolute shit show. There were cops walking around with guns and civilian clothing. It was easy for misinformation to build with that; we thought there were multiple shooters for a while because a lot of people thought cops were the shooters and posted photos of officers with shotguns in plain jeans.      I was hiding in a classroom with my clubmates and the cops were screaming at us to put our hands in the air and breaking our barricades to the door. At the time we thought the shooter impersonated cops to get us to open the door. They were aggressive with guns drawn at my face.     The cops literally escorted us outside and abandoned us. They said there were cops at the front of the building waiting for us but they were lying. It was so horribly mismanaged that we went back to the barricaded room and didn't leave until the press release four hours later.     The shooter had to have walked over an hour to where he killed himself. There wasn't any danger for so long and the cops didn't stop him at all, the absolute cunts. I have no respect for what they did because they did nothing but traumatize thousands of students just like me. Not only that but in some places like in Chicago, the university police department has jurisdiction over the city itself and often makes arrests How many shootings happened annually in the country you visited? They had one security guard for 35,000 students? Where in Europe would you compare to LA?  Don't you think most europeans would find themselves shocked at how different this country and lifestyle is?  I remember being shocked that US universities have their own police departments, they aren't necessary if you have local police. It's the doing of your own propaganda and fear-mongering. I feel safer with the UCPD than the police department in the city I live. Every interaction I‚Äôve had with them have been extremely pleasant. I‚Äôm going to step in here (and I know I‚Äôm late to the thread) but as a student at MSU, the police did do things to ensure safety. In fact, they security cleared dorms where the shooter was reported and set up systems to ensure that if the shooter was in the area the students would be protected that were cleared.   Also, MSU‚Äôs campus is over 5,000 acres in size, and is connected to downtown East Lansing from where the shooting happened, so it was going to be difficult to find him and get him.   Overall, could things have been done better? Probably, but to say the cops did nothing to ensure safety is wrong. Is their job to prevent crime or enforce the law? How could they have done better to ensure the safety of students after the shooting? Maybe we should enact laws that prevents criminals from getting guns to kill people > They also serve to hide campus sexual assaults since they don't have to share the info with say LAPD and it keeps the stats low.  Under the Clery Act, they still have to report sexual assaults. https://dailybruin.com/2021/05/24/protesters-renew-calls-to-abolish-ucpd-in-march-across-ucla-campus Exactly.  UCPD is under the university's control.  If UCPD became a subdivision of LAPD, it would be under the control of city politicians.   There are many special-purpose police departments in LA.  LAX, LAUSD, LA Harbor, and LA Parks and Rec each have their own police departments. > Setting aside the larger defund argument - having a specialized police force for a specific population is very helpful in my opinion.  That's true, but it's also inefficient.  UCPD needs a lot of officers at certain times, such as move-in week or finals week, plus party nights.  And then the campus is dead during breaks and summer.  So being able to distribute officers throughout LA would be more efficient and cheaper. THIS is also poor logic \"it has detrimental effects on high schools that rely on police for campus security.\"  Do you have a cite to any research on this? Lol, sure. That's what they do. If youre talking about the one in 2016, pretty sure it was students/professors who did that. LAPD would‚Äôve come through but Lowkey they‚Äôre much worse than UCPD https://dailybruin.com/2021/05/24/protesters-renew-calls-to-abolish-ucpd-in-march-across-ucla-campus Any defense is better than 0 defense. Police response seemed good here.   https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-shooting-university-suspec/ucla-murder-suicide-gunman-had-planned-third-killing-police-say-idUSKCN0YO1T5 I guess being a Physics Grad Student doesn‚Äôt make you smart after-allüíÄ It‚Äôs not common sense to believe a group that has had minimal training to save you in an event of a shooting.   Cmon bro, you‚Äôre smarter than that. UCPD technically has primary jurisdiction within a certain distance of campus (I think half mile?) and regular jurisdiction statewide, like any other police department in California. Exactly, that's the point. Rate of stabbings in UK is 2.5x higher. Yes, Europeans would definitely find it shocking.  I think it was more like 20,000 students, which is similar to many UC campuses, but a bit smaller than UCLA. Your comment needs way more likes and views. Thank you for contributing to the conversation. There was no danger to make safe after the shooter died. Agreed, the efficiency issue is a big problem - especially for small departments.  Also, small departments tend to have more problems with oversight, nepotism, overtime, etc.  I still think it works at the UC level but I definitely share your concerns with smaller agencies. I didn't declare logic. I presented evidence.  https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1782&context=facultypub  https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-report-reveals-racial-disparities-in-arrests-by-los-angeles-unified-school-district-police  https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/legal-documents/aclu_bullies_in_blue_4_11_17_final.pdf  Logically, it makes sense if you think about the implications. I could go on about it but all of these cover what Id say regardless. [removed] Screw off with this bs Exactly Thanks. exactly. as a physics grad student, I can vouch for your comment, it does not :\"} alright you go in and stop the shooter. Yeah in my freshman year they told a story of how they arrested a USC student at the USC campus for vandalizing the bruinbear. You can‚Äôt ‚Äúmass stab‚Äù crowds of people like you can with a gun Is this even true? Care to cite a source? [This](https://infogram.com/us-vs-uk-on-knife-crime-1hmr6gyrxmlo6nl) source disagrees Of course it is because they dont have access to guns. People are gonna kill eachother no matter what. Outlaw guns they use knives. And the ridiculous thing is that, at least from what I understand, UC campuses will share officers when needed.  So if UCLA PD needs more officers for some reason, they will get them from UCI or UCR PD rather than LAPD, which makes no sense. Upvote for the cites.  Have to disagree on the logically though.  \"\\[H\\]as detrimental effects on high schools . . .\" - none of the three cited works note any detrimental effects on *high schools*.  Two of them (UFL and ACLU) describe potential detrimental consequences for students that have interactions (arrest, diversion, citations) with school police.  Since those students comprise between 0.05% and 0.3% of the school populations depending on your source (even substantially less when compared to a control population), no logic would allow you to extrapolate that to \"high schools\" in general.    The UCLA cite, sadly, doesn't qualify as scholarly research under any circumstances.  A press release that refers to a \"report\" that links to a two-page handout which copies information almost verbatim from a FOIA request is not scholarship - it's an 11th grader's homework assignment.  No original research, no initial question, no methodology, no logic, no analysis, no discussion - just nothing (except conclusions). Thank you. I thought this was common knowledge but I guess not. Happy Cake day! Take reports after the crime has occurred. Lol what do you think they do? Anyone who‚Äôs ever interacted with the police knows all they do is show up hours after something happened and then scribble something down and forget about it, best case. Worst case they find a way to incriminate you and then you‚Äôre fucked because you called them for help. Guess that‚Äôs what we should expect considering they‚Äôre not obligated to protect citizens though lol They tell people calling 911 that calling 911 is only for \"real emergencies\" when my gf was calling when I wasn't texting/calling back for 8 hours. Turns out I was unconscious on campus for 5+ hours after getting hit in my skateboard.. (this was during covid)   They're useless lmao.  Still a bad idea to get rid of em though that's for sure. ucla needs to step it up.üíî WTF?!   Guess you‚Äôre not smart after all. on average mass knifings yield the same amount of casualties as mass shootings  guns have potential for more danger  guns are more dangerous because people are stupid Yeah, you can google 2022 knifings in UK vs US, divide the number by the population of each country, and there are 2.5x more stabbings per person in the UK.  That's a terrible source, and is talking about murders. > Of course it is because they dont have access to guns. People are gonna kill eachother no matter what. Outlaw guns they use knives.  Sounds like a good plan to me.  They use knives and kill 1 or 2 people instead of 10 or 20. You're right, but so who has it better?   You're more likely to get in a knife fight than you are a gun fight in general right? It takes more balls to shoot someone than to swipe someone with a knife.  The UK has access to guns, but their population has never been interested in self defense.   If you're in the UK and someone shoots you, or starts stabbing you, you can prevent it with a knife.  If you're in the US and someone shoots you, or starts stabbing you, you can shoot back.  The problem in the US is that people either are, or feel too irresponsible to trust themselves with a firearm.  No one has that problem with a knife.  There is a lack of education. Did she think to look for you? Someone not answering their phone for 8 hours is in no world an emergency. I mean what else are we going to do??? Our quickly accessible line of defense is gone because y‚Äôall wanted to remove them. Don‚Äôt go crying nowü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Citation needed. I can‚Äôt find any US statistics for knife crimes other than murders. I would be surprised to find that the UK has significantly more knife crime and yet significantly less fatal stabbings. That source is also literally just a visualization of FBI statistics, you‚Äôre welcome to look at the raw data if you‚Äôre unsure about the visualization. Furthermore, if getting rid of guns reduces overall homicide at the expense of more non-fatal stabbings, that seems like a net positive to me.  Once again, do you have any stats you can cite here? I google 2022 USA knife crime stats and only got murder stats - which were higher in the US than the UK You wish I mean i would argue that ita impulse control. Like theres scores of videos and instances were people have gotten angry and pulled out a gun. I wouls argue guns are worse cause its easier for a group to deal with someone with a knife vs a 20 round gun > The problem in the US is that people either are, or feel too irresponsible to trust themselves with a firearm.  You're right.  Too few people with guns.  That's the whole problem in the US.    Seriously I can't tell  if your post is satire or serious. Yeah I get that it's not unusual to not text/answer for 6-8 hours but it was during summer 2020, and it was unusual for that time lmao. We basically lived together. She did look for me but I think I was passed out somewhat out of sight, so hard to find me I guess. It's a blur for me. But it would be nice if police took her seriously... I had a very bad injury to say the least.. 5 days in ICU + 1 week hospital > our quickly accessible line of defense   Tell that to the victims of Uvalde, Colombine, etc‚Ä¶ whats impulse control?  there's scores of videos of people pulling out a knife or gun when angry  mass knifings typically have as many victims as mass shootings  you're right, but barely, and I'd credit it to the fact that the skill gap between gun owners and the average person is larger than the gap between knife owners and the average person, but that just means people are stupid You think the problem in the US is people walking around with guns when less than 1/10 people walk around with guns? you do realize each school‚Äôs police department utilizes different protocols right? stop making generalizations. Context matters buddy. > mass knifings typically have as many victims as mass shootings  lol what?    When was the last time a \"mass knifing\" killed 10 people? Yes, given that the US is pretty much the only country on the planet where people walk around with guns. Less than 1/10 is still millions of people, and they can cause a lot of problems. Their only counter argument to you telling them to step in and stop a potential shooter was an ad hominem attack. \"You're stupid because you just are and I have no counter to your argument because I can't come up with one.\" Once they throw in the ad hominem attack you just know they're defeated in every possible way. when was the last time that was typical for mass shootings?  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/knife-attack-china-train-station-leaves-27-dead That issue is with people, not guns üß† yes 1000% they‚Äôre real silent now There are mass shootings with 10+ victims practically every year in the US, sometimes multiple times a year.   How many mass knifings with 10 victims happen per year, anywhere in the world? No, the issue is with the guns.  There's nothing special about Americans that makes them prone to killing each other.  They just have the tools to do it more easily. There are yearly stabbings of 10+ people, you're delusional to think not.  How often do shootings lead to 10 victims?  https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2022/9/5/ten-killed-in-canada-stabbing-spree-what-where-and-who Do you not understand the difference between anecdotes and data?

Rating of the class, is it on the easier side, how is the workload, how are the finals + midterms? Would you recommend the class? Take it. Purdy doesn‚Äôt do homework, midterms, or finals Econ 165 vs 148 I am trying to decide between taking Econ 165 with Surro or Econ 148 with Lu. I've heard mixed opinions, so if anyone could weigh in on what they thought was easier, I would really appreciate it! Didn‚Äôt take either but 165 is easier since it has less of the theoretical math apparently. Impossible to get it though unless you have priority enrollment or an early senior first pass Taking Econ 165 rn and it‚Äôs much easier than any other upper div Econ class I‚Äôve taken. Surro is a great professor and the content is super interesting What should i first pass? Math32B, CS33, Physics 1a Does CS33 fill up? If you are a CS/CSE/CE major, first pass Physics 1A and Math 32B. CS33 shouldn't fill out by the second pass, but if it does, you can fill out an ECR, and you'll likely get in. Also, I would highly recommend not taking CS 33 in Spring and doing it in the fall. Take 35L instead. Why 35L over CS33 in your eyes? Im a math of comp major, can i still get do the ecr? The stuff you learn and build in 35L will be useful to put on your resume when you're applying for internships during the summer and fall. I also don't like Reinman's teaching style so I avoid him. I'm not sure tbh. You should speak to a counselor. Wear a mask if you're sick or coughing you selfish fuck  confession I coughed in class 2 days ago but it was because the espresso bean I was eating was really dry and stuck to back of my throat I tried really hard to keep the cough in but i was afraid i was gonna throw up in class sorry I used to attend ucla before the pandemic and I would get sick so often because there were so many people in class just openly coughing without covering their mouths and obviously nobody wore a mask. [deleted] i have chronic cough symptoms and cover my mouth when i cough  people with chronic cough shouldn‚Äôt be forced to wear a mask 24/7, this post is extremely ignorant ffs Nah, not everyone coughing is sick, you selfish fuck. [removed] Some of us have heartburn lovey I'll let you slide on that one that or coughing into a sweater or shirt should be good - the problem is the number of people who just cough into open air like first graders And why exactly should yall not be forced to wear a mask?And thats even worse imo because you might be sick and if you are,youll just ignore it as this \"chronic cough\" symptoms i also have a chronic cough and know damn well this post isn't about our small minority. get over yourself it‚Äôs still gross to cough openly. just cover it. username checks out I won‚Äôt üòàüòà I agree with you, it's disrespectful to cough with the mouth open. He‚Äôs one of my top customers Can anyone hold Physics 5C for me? If you can hold this class for me please pm me! I will pay!! 16-year-old will be the youngest UCLA grad this year, will graduate summa cum laude after only 2 years at UCLA  And a cognitive science major with a specialization in computing.   She‚Äôs going somewhere! Hopefully her mental health holds up This is amazing, it really is. At the same time I feel like she should enjoying her childhood. What's the rush to start adulthood and your career? To each their own I suppose. This is super impressive, shes obviously motivated as hell. But what Im more surprised by is that she was actually able to get all her classes in considering how terrible class scheduling/registration is here Silly question but can you go to any college at any age? It‚Äôs stupid, but I‚Äôve only noticed people my age and older, with the exception of a few high schoolers, but those are for summer courses. This is pretty neat actually. Nerd!  JK, i'm envious as hell, and am glad such a talent chose the University of California, Los Angeles. AND she's a stellar athlete.   She's going to crush it wherever she goes, all the best too her. I mean this great academically and im sure she will go far but what about her childhood? Does she have anyone her own age she can hangout with and relate to? Like go her shes clearly very intelligent but how did this affect her socially? Envious & insecure gunners are downvoting this I just wanna be her üò≠ its great but kinda sad bc she was never old enough to really enjoy the experience of being in college. but im sure it doesn‚Äôt matter to some people 12 prep classes 8 major 2 fieldwork/research  specialization in computing requires 1 class outside of the prep for the major..  23 classes in 8 quarters?  2.9 classes a quarter.. she could even shave it down to 22 classes if she does CS instead of the PIC series, even less if she got credit from highschool  Most people I know finish it in 2-3 years.  This major has been a joke for some time now, and I'm surprised it's considered legitimate.The comments on this post are a great example. People hear \"degree\"! and think they're all equal. Too many members of society have been taking advantage of this and manipulating others into thinking they're qualified for positions, or intelligent, simply for having a degree.   I feel like pretty much ANY student at this school COULD do this, the question is why would you want to.  The answer is it saves you a-lot of money, and you fool a-lot of people into thinking you're smart.   I'm sure she's really smart in general considering she is graduating summa cum laude. But you have to wonder what the rush is to graduate it with a Cog Sci Major.  It doesn't prepare you for any engineering or serious software development positions unless she's already a coding god, and in that case why would she have to come here? It could make sense if you want to go to grad school, so maybe if you want to rush to get there?  But she really doesn't have the college experience that every other one of their applicants has? Lol this is the person Asian parents compare their kids to...I hope my parents don't find out about her!! The other side of the coin is those truly gifted would feel intellectually unchallenged.  Terence Tao finished his master's degree at the age of 16, receiving his PhD at the age of 21, and became a full professor at age of 24.  I am glad to see this 16-yr old plans to focus on her rhythmic gymnastics and take a break from academics after graduating from UCLA. Yea, last quarter I met a girl in the dorms who was a masters student at 18, cause she finished Stanford at 17. Kinda said that it was a bit disappointing rushing her life and a big reason she was back was to be able to live like everyone else. She probably had really good registration times. Since my friend came in w/ a ton of AP credits which gave her advanced standing, she had really good registration times. I, on the other hand, did not. They‚Äôre willing to bend the rules a bit if you are exceptionally smart. yep, she 100% missed out on the college experience in favor of academic advancement It should have been me :‚Äô( Not really comparable  And here's why for all you confident disbelievers:  He got his masters in mathematics by her age, so he was more forward in his career, unlimited opportunities with whoever he wants.   She's practically majored in nothing through an accelerated program which most people finish in a quarter or two more than her...  Please show me how the future of this girl compares at all to terence tao, or even how her education compared. Why not Terence Tao is comparable to this girl?  Why not, why so? There is about 1 thing in common? graduation at 16? you're a clown to ignore the 99 other factors Terence tao at the age of 16 is equivalent to this girl at the age of 16 yes no definitely not, he finished his masters in math at 16  and he certainly wasn't a cog sci major ü§£ In terms of going to college to be intellectually stimulated as the commenter said, yes comparable.  I didn‚Äôt realize you were in a position to judge anyhow, what age were you when you graduated? Isn't that why we all go to college? I'm in as much of a position to judge as anyone else is here..maybe more so than cog sci majors but...  Idk what to tell you, an accelerated degree program is no where near comparable to a masters.  Especially mathematics vs cog sci Syllabus for Prof. Roper‚Äôs math 170e I wonder if anyone still has Prof. Roper‚Äôs syllabus for math 170e?

Math 32A tutor How can I get a tutor for this does anyone have recommendations I can help. Message me This isn‚Äôt a specific tutor recommendation, but I know that most TAs offer paid tutoring. You could check out the student math center and see which TA works best for you and then check and see if they offer paid tutoring. I know their rates are higher than undergrad tutors, but they are also more educated and experienced. Also, depending on how much tutoring you need, the SMC (+ attending your TA‚Äôs & professor‚Äôs office hours) may provide enough help for you, and it‚Äôs entirely free If you need help moving let me know https://tr.co/mohmmed-m hold a class pls (def will pay!) hiii im looking for someone to hold a class for me ofc for pay!!! message me if interested :))) My team and I made a UC Dating Simulator Where You Date Personified UC Colleges Including UCLA :) (link in comments)  I been sayin we need a game where you can date busty personified colleges the coomer legion thanks you Is gene block a secret character Can we unlock the secret Prison Break ending by romancing Andre?

Of course! Happy to help! Your goal is to ask out one of the UC Love interests out to the dance. Eligible candidates include Ellie, Kelly, Irene, Riviera, Santana, Stan, and Tommy. Every love interest has a set \"schedule\" and appear in the same locations at the same times of day (ex: Kelly is in the cafe in the morning and in the library in the afternoon and evening). In order to get a love interest to like you, you can talk to them repeatedly and give them gifts to get closer to them. Each love interest (aside from Stan, who hates all gifts) has gifts that they like and dislike, and give verbal cues when you find their most loved gift!  You can earn money for gifts by playing minigames, which are located in the plaza, gym, and cafe. To play a minigame, go to the plaza/gym/cafe and press work. If you struggle with these, you can work in the library for a small but guaranteed amount of money.  As you get closer to your love interest, they might be a little more open towards you or more flirty with you. At this point, you might be able to successfully ask them on a date, which is another way to further build a relationship with them. If they reject you for a date, talk/give gifts to them a little more before trying again. Getting rejected lowers your relationship score a little, so make sure based on dialogue that you think you have a decent shot before asking them out for a date!  After a couple of dates and getting even closer to your love interest, when you are really close to each other, you can ask them out to the dance and finish the game :) Let me know if there are any other things I can clear up! Frfr Dating sims have been around for a long time. This isn‚Äôt new There‚Äôs been a rise in satirical or half-joking dating sums over the years and I wanted to make something similar to that! While there are adults that enjoy serious dating simulators like mystic messenger and huniepop, there‚Äôs a good amount of teens and adults that enjoy satirical dating sims as well. They can be a pretty good laugh if you‚Äôre feeling down! If you‚Äôre new to the satirical dating sim genre, I recommend the John Cena dating sim and the KFC dating sim, but you might want to familiarize yourself with the dating sim genre to better understand the satire!   Overall though, life is short and cringe is dead! As long as you‚Äôre not hurting anyone, I think it‚Äôs totally fine to engage in something silly from time to time :) This is the first thing I've seen on this sub that made me instantly nauseous.  Edit: I think the comment section is worse than the game. This should get ratioed to oblivion. UC hastings! Bug should be fixed by the way! I just kept giving gifts every time I saw her. she deserves it. (you need to give the special gift after raising her affection enough to unlock the date, i think) Technically the minimum number you need to give her if you never talk to her ever is like 15 :) if you talk to her each time you gave her a gift it should be 10. we just upped the amount of relationship points talking gives to make things easier and less grindy though! :) Maybe my build was old (sometime last year) but I tried giving UCI a bunch of red bull but it seems like nothing happened. Approximately how many red bulls does it take to advance the relationship state machine? I know is not new but damn, I refuse to believe grown as people, adults, do this type of stuff. I think the concept of doing this is more tongue-in-cheek than anything. Yes, there‚Äôs an audience of people out there who do sincerely play these for kinda weird reasons, but from a less cynical perspective, they‚Äôre a funny, campy creative outlet for developers, writers, and artists, and some people also enjoy checking them out for  more meta reasons related to that. Agreed In the old version, it would take 15 if you never talked to her, but 10 if you talked to her each time you gave her a b-fuel. We just released a new version that should make the romancing phase a little faster and less grindy though! :) Definitely! We‚Äôre just a team of people wanting to create a silly little game for people to enjoy. The dating sim and the dev team behind it doesn‚Äôt take things too seriously. The game itself is somewhere between satire and an actual dating sim and I think tongue-in-cheek is an accurate descriptor.  UC Love was a bit of a learning project as well as a creative outlet for the dev team! A lot of the developers including myself learned new skills with programming, writing, art, and project development. Life‚Äôs short and as long as you‚Äôre not hurting anyone, why not be a little cringe :) the water at sproul is cold asf im freezingüòû when r they gonna fix this Same at Sunset Village!

I want to continue to be on a calorie deficit to advance my weight loss journey but I‚Äôm not sure what to eat on the hill. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not vegan or a vegetarian so I don‚Äôt gravitate to a lot of the food with those choices. So I was wondering if I‚Äôd be able to stay in a calorie deficit if I eat Rende burritos or bowl once a day? Or would that be too much calorie intake that delays weight loss? Use this calculator to determine your TDEE: https://www.calculator.net/tdee-calculator.html   Type ‚Äúlittle to no exercise‚Äù for your maintenance calories and determine how much you want your deficit to be. If you‚Äôre in a 500 calorie deficit per day, you would lose approximately 1 pound per week.   Use the UCLA housing app to determine the calories in your burrito. You can build it directly in the app and it will give you all of the macros. You can play with different ingredients to fit your daily intake needs.  Hope this helped! i‚Äôd say you‚Äôd be fine! i‚Äôm currently in a calorie deficit and i eat rende burritos like every other day. usually when i do i plan to eat a little less during my other meals but that‚Äôs up to you!! :) It depends on what your calorie deficit is. I do this. One rende bowl a day baby. Is your plan to only eat a single rende burrito or bowl as your only meal throughout your day? If it is, you‚Äôll certainly lose weight, but I wouldn‚Äôt really advise this steep of a caloric deficit. There is a limited amount of energy that your body can liberate from fat per day, and any more weight loss is probably going to come from muscle which is probably undesirable. If you have an apple watch (or maybe another wearable fitness tracker) there are ways to estimate daily calories burned and you can go from there. Thank you very much! This is really helpful! I really appreciate it! Thank you for your help! Quick question, so when you do eat Rende burritos, the other meals you‚Äôre referring to are your breakfast or dinner meals right? Once again thanks for your input! Honestly Rende burritos are probably what I enjoy eating the most so it‚Äôs nice to know that it would be fine to do so while I‚Äôm on a calorie deficit :) Do you suggest eating the rende bowls over the rende burritos since I‚Äôm on a calorie deficit or would it be fine if I mainly ate the rende burritos? Thanks for your help by the way! :) Hi! Yes that was my plan. Thank you very much for your input! What fitness tracker do you recommend? yeah i meant breakfast and lunch. and same rende burritos slap I was mainly a burrito girl but converted mainly because of the chips. Eating the bowls is a lot more tolerable with the chips! I'd either do the burrito, no chips. Or a bowl with chips. But really just look at the nutrition here [http://menu.dining.ucla.edu/Menus/Rendezvous](http://menu.dining.ucla.edu/Menus/Rendezvous) ! If burritos work with your filler choices then do that! :) I personally just try to roughly estimate calories and protein, and track my weight every bit for my personal fitness goals. I think tracking macros and my weight daily could pretty easily transition into an ED or at least disordered behavior, and my current approach has been working pretty well for me.   In my opinion, the easiest way to go is to probably just try to estimate calories and see if your weight is decreasing from week to week. If it isn‚Äôt, eat healthier or less. If you really want to estimate, look at a tdee calculator like someone mentioned above and eat a few hundred calories below as a starting point. Fitness trackers aren‚Äôt necessary but they make calorie tracking a bit easier.   Good luck with the weight loss! Try to eat at maintenance for a week every several weeks if you‚Äôre going for a long weight loss phase, eating at a deficit for a very prolonged time period isn‚Äôt great for your hormones/metabolism.   One last tip! Divide your (estimated) body fat by 20 for the maximum percent of your weight you can lose each week. Any more and you‚Äôll probably end up losing muscle and feel crappy. To the kind dude who said Happy Valentines Day and gave a tulip to me near Luskin Genuinely, thank you so much- I was so surprised I could only stammer a thank you but it really made my day ü´∂ hope you know how much that gesture meant to me and that you see this :) You're welcome.

My roommate wants to get her nails done for her birthday but we don‚Äôt know anyone who does nails without having to go to a nail salon yazenailedit on instagram! understudy to the girls in the understudy right now, SHUT THE FUCK UP this place is as loud as ackerman ! dawg confront them. normalize telling people to be quiet. Gym people Get off your phones. Other people need to use the machines. You don‚Äôt need 15 min between sets. The lack of awareness is outstanding confront them then tf Sorry bro- I think it might‚Äôve been me. I was trying to pr and was taking resting intervals of 2-3 minutes. 315 up next 100% of the time when I ask someone to switch on a machiner they is using they say YES. We need to rest sometimes 5 mins between each set and we are not going to stare at the ceiling for 5mins. So yes we are on our phone. Really don't hesitate to ask, gym people are nice people Nah hard disagree here. Taking 3 ish minutes in between sets is optimal and completely acceptable. just ask to work in, 2-3 minute rests normal Y‚Äôall are acting like my man was just taking a few min between sets and that I said nothing. No he was taking 10-15 min between each set and when I asked to work in he said he wanted to finish his sets alone Say something UCLA kids are pushovers the rests are not the main issue. The issue is fitting 30k students in two gyms. Yeah lol, definitely enough time to work in No problem, wasn‚Äôt you! Excuse my French but that guys a bitch Looking for people to join RSU group for single dorm (F) Basically what title says, if anyone wants to join my group (especially if you have an RSU time before 3/7 8am) feel free to DM :) (My group is looking to be in a plaza single btw)  &#x200B; I‚Äôm interested!! Any Caroline Polachek fans on here? I was thinking of going to her show in late April and wanted to see if anyone would be interested in meeting up to go together/sharing an uber. The show is at the Shrine Auditorium, across the street from USC, and the cheap tickets are for only around $25. Message me if this piques your interest! Wait she has a concert here?? I just discovered her music she‚Äôs lit Ya! She is touring for her new album. üî•üî•üî• Data Science Engineering Course Path What is the best course path to take for the data science engineering minor? Classes that aren't insanely hard, but provide valuable knowledge on the subject.   Thanks. It depends what your goal is.  If you want the most useful classes (for machine learning), take ECE C147. It's one of the harder classes on the list, but deep learning is absolutely an essential skill to have. You can pair it with CS 162 (formerly 188 NLP), another class that isn't easy but very useful.  If you want easier classes, Stats 115 is incredibly interesting but very workload-light. It is only offered once a year with a low capacity, however. CS 161 is also on the easier side of CS electives, and if you take it before Stats 115 then 115 is a breeze. 161 is offered pretty much every quarter. The downside of this route is that symbolic AI isn't super useful in industry (although Bayesian Networks are pretty cool and useful).  If you want a more software engineering bent, take CS 180 and 143. Neither are particularly easy, but you need  to learn algorithms (and should learn databases) if you want to be a SWE (and you're not a CS major). Somewhere to get some work done on campus? Does anyone have suggestions for some place where I can get some work done on campus - while not being a student?I‚Äôm an alum from over two decades ago, so I‚Äôm familiar with campus (even if it‚Äôs Under Construction Like Always). I‚Äôm r/taking my wife to get some tests done at the medical center, so I‚Äôll be ‚Äústuck‚Äù on campus trying to get some work done, and I‚Äôd rather not spend four hours holed up in an underground parking lot. Most of my work day is spent in meetings, so I can‚Äôt realistically just park myself outside Kerkhoff for hours. Any suggestions? you can sit at kerckhoff or ackerman (or anywhere really) nobody will care. there‚Äôs plenty of older students here anyways. if you‚Äôre looking for a quiet place to have meetings, that may be a bit tougher, as you probably don‚Äôt want to talk loudly in a library I‚Äôve seen people working on laptops for hours in the lobby of the Luskin conference center/hotel. It may not be great if you have to talk a lot on your calls or if the lobby noise will be heard by the people on the other end of your call, but it‚Äôs a comfortable hotel lobby option.    Another idea, as an alum, you may want to check inside the James West Alumni Center to see if they might let you sit at an empty desk or in an empty conference room?  They may say no, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask?   A third idea, try the lobby/living room of the Tiverton hotel at the corner of Le Conte and Tiverton in Westwood. This is right across the street from the medical school. The Tiverton is a hotel run by UCLA Health and it is intended for families to stay while relatives are receiving medical treatment. I stayed there last Friday night and the lobby/living room to the left of the front entrance had several chairs for hanging out with coffee and water available and it was a quiet space. Since your wife is receiving medical treatments I think they might let you hang out in the lobby/living room space??? Because this facility is run as an extension of UCLA Health, this building requires a face mask at all times.  I hope this helps!  Fellow Alum, Class of ‚Äò89 YRL is nice Rabbit Rehome These are very specific circumstances. Today I unfortunately had to surrender my pet bunny. My housing situation did not allow for him anymore. I feel absolutely terrible, I never wanted to surrender him, I was trying to find a new home for him but it was really difficult. fortunately the shelter told me that if he is not adopted I can call and request him or I can find a foster home for him. They will provide all the supplies for the foster and I would pay the fee for him to adopted. I just can't stand the thought that he might end up in a home that is not suitable. He is in West LA. I feel so worried for him and the stress he may be going through. Please let me know. He is 3 years old this May and he will be neutered and vaccinated. aw, i have a rabbit and i can imagine how hard this must be. sending love to you and your bun üíú Rabbit Mahomes He‚Äôs with me now. We are chillin eating carrots Love on the brain What does love mean to you? This Valentine‚Äôs Day, UCLA Radio asked UCLA to send in their deepest desires, greatest heartbreaks, and meandering thoughts on love. You told us that love is an infinite longing, love is the need to be known, love is an inability to get over someone, but most of all, it is something to be shared. From fears of dying alone to flabbergasting love triangles, [read on](https://uclaradio.com/love-on-the-brain/) to learn how UCLA students love, and how we responded.  https://preview.redd.it/7rqnqclbj9ia1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ac47a2d7e9027495432d1b9344684b0577ada1f8 Can hold a class My enrollment is on the 17th at 10 am. Only have one required class left so I can hold any other 4-5 unit class along with it. Negotiable on price but I‚Äôll reserve it for whoever pays me most hi! i‚Äôm interested hiii im interested if still available!! Anyone know if there's a place to borrow poker chips? Title Thanks! Borrow? Unlikely   But I think you can buy a set at Target Summer internship housing in NYC? I have an internship in NYC this summer and I am curious if anyone has any insight into how to get a rental/sublease. I would really appreciate hearing about anyone's experience -- when/how they found accommodations, how much it generally costs, etc.   Also, if any fellow girl bruins who are also interning in NYC this summer are interested in rooming with me/looking for a place to stay together pls direct message me haha. My internship is from end of spring quarter to mid-august and is located in manhattan (although I would also be open to staying in brooklyn as long as the commute isn't too long). I think you could start by FB housing groups for the universities (Columbia, NYU, etc.) and maybe there'll be someone who's subletting! Some unis might also be leasing out their dorms for the summer, but it might be difficult because their dates often allign with a semester system schedule. There's also StreetEasy for apartments, but that might be tough because those are more for residents and long-term leases. I know you can get housing through nyu and it‚Äôs not super expensive it‚Äôs basically just the dorms If you want to save money there‚Äôs nothing wrong with staying outside of Manhattan. NYC public transport is great, depending on where your office is in Manhattan the commute should be pretty comfortable from most parts of the city. I used to rent a 3 bedroom apartment in the Bronx for $3000, I‚Äôd expect to pay 1.5-2x that at least in Manhattan. How to remove marker from dorm door whiteboards? I have no idea how to remove the dry erase marker from the 'whiteboards' next to our dorm door. You'd assume they're just regular whiteboards üò≠ regular dry erase eraser, wipes and alcohol wipes don't work; idk how some people are removing theirs Hand sanitizer (has rubbing alcohol in it) and a paper towel works draw over it again with fresh dry erase marker and wipe it while it‚Äôs still wet I scrubbed for hours to remove mine. Those aren't normal whiteboards /: Rubbing alcohol on a paper towel. Worked for me last year. Acetone (nail polish remover) I think hand sanitizer and a tissue worked for me, but another thing I tried was using a fresh marker and scribbling on top of the old marks, then erasing them together with rubbing alcohol. It‚Äôs like that trick to remove sharpie from whiteboards. Acetone may dissolve the plastic on the surface of the white board. Test it on a small portion first before you fully commit. UCLA MAE Grad Recruitment Open House Hi, current UCI student who applied to UCLA for a PhD in mechanical engineering :)  I received an email earlier today inviting me to a grad applicant open house in March. For grad students in the past who were also invited to a similar event, is this basically a guarantee that I will soon be officially accepted, or is there still a pretty good chance either way? Thank you!! No, it's not a guarantee, but as it says in the email, it indicates that you are high in the list of applicants.

I saw a post on here talking about how Cafe 1919 looks like it is being prepped to reopen, and then a comment underneath it said how it will be plant based upon the rumored reopening. I was checking the description for the dining services and now it mentions vegan and vegetarian foods, but I am not really sure what it said before. Did the description change? Meaning that there will be a veggie reopening? Or has it always said that and served meat anyways. I dont want to get my hopes up but a vegan dining option would be soooooooooo niceeeeeeee Necklace Found at IM Field I found a mens(?) silver necklace last Wednesday at the IM fields. Just got to posting it. If it‚Äôs yours you must give enough accurate detail to convince me you‚Äôre legit. One week until next Wed this time. Math Department COVID Policy Have a midterm in a few days and I'm starting to get sick... Ive tested but haven't gotten my results back yet. My prof in the syllabus says theres no makeup midterms or accommodations so I'm really worried I'll have to get a 0 on this midterm. I've emailed the prof but she hasn't responded yet. Does anyone know what the COVID policy is for the math department is? Will the weight of the midterm be shifted onto the weight of the final? Hi, I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I would also email CAE ASAP. The official UCLA policy says you must isolate and report to ASHE. I would report it just to cover yourself in case the prof turns out to be an ass.  Policy: https://ucla.app.box.com/s/ytuwjy4j3ntmvfuexfga6jxmwseu6ghd  Ultimately it is up to the prof how they will deal with it. We can‚Äôt tell you if they‚Äôll shift, give you a different exam, etc.  Good luck, hope you get well soon. The math UD‚Äôs usually have fall backs built into the grading scale.   Max( Midterm 1, Midterm 2) + Final   If you miss one of the midterms then the other midterm automatically becomes the Max. Found Necklace At IM Field I found a mens(?) silver necklace last Wednesday on IM field. Forgot to post about.

Financial Issues Hi, does ucla provide any kind of help with economic relief? I know that there is an organization on campus but I don't know how they would be able to help me in my case. I recently moved to a sublease off campus and I experienced some unexpected costs that my refund check did not cover, and I am having trouble paying next months rent. Does anyone know how ucla can help me or who to contact? The Economic Crisis Response Team (ECRT) can be a valuable resource for getting short term loans and emergency grants if eligible: https://studentincrisis.ucla.edu/economic-crisis-response  Their office does get pretty backed up from time to time though, but if you‚Äôre an aid recipient the financial aid office can also offer additional assistance if needed such as increasing your financial aid amount through grants and loans. You can contact them through the message center and explain your situation, and they can walk you through your options. Hi, how can I know if I am eligible for an emergency grant? Unfortunately I‚Äôm not sure :( the offices typically review these things on a case-by-case basis, so your best option is to just reach out to them and see if and how they can help you! Amazon lockers How does one get their packages sent to the dorm Amazon lockers instead of the mail room? you select the locker as the address instead of the mailroom Where? are you ordering from Amazon Yes Dropping after week 4 Has anybody drop a class after week 4 this quarter and not receive a transcript notation? I remember when I dropped a class after week 4 my first quarter, it warned me that I‚Äôd receive a notation on my transcript. But before I go through with dropping it doesn‚Äôt mention anything about a notation/warning. i just dropped a class during week 6 and it didn‚Äôt say anything about a transcript notation but it does say on my transcript ‚Äúclass dropped - week 6‚Äù Why tf are all easy upper divs major restricted? Bruh let me graduate with some decent GPA plz If you‚Äôre interested in a restricted class, you can always try emailing the professor to see if they‚Äôre able to give you a PTE number. It helps if you know the professor already (e.g., from having taken an unrestricted class they teach) and can show that you have some familiarity with the subject, especially if the class also has prerequisites you haven‚Äôt taken. In any case, the worst that could happen is they say no. Give it a shot. MCDB 138 restricted? Tryna enroll in MCDB 138, I'm MIMG and this is one of our upper divs electives. Will the restriction go away on second pass or am I fucked? lavelle 14b curve so on midterm 1 he said he‚Äôs not curving it even tho the average was a 77, does he usually curve the final grades or nah? Depends on your grade, I took him in Fall 2020 and the curve ranged from none for an A grade to being quite a bit for the C and lower range but the exams had an about a B average so it may be diff i don‚Äôt think he curved final grades fall 2020. he boosted everyone for the final because i think he realized he made it too unfair. in the end he doesn‚Äôt curve final grades but he basically boosts you up to the next letter grade (unless you already have an A and don‚Äôt need it) Where is Rolfe hall 3134 I'm only seeing hundreds classes on the third floor?

De Neve is actually the healthiest dining hall for me I used to eat mostly at BPlate because the food options there are the healthiest out of all the dining halls, but what started to happen was that I'd overeat there, simply because the individual portions aren't that bad for you. This would result in me eating like 1200+ calories for dinner sometimes.  With De Neve, on the other hand, I just stick to the Flex Bar and load my plate with a huge variety of veggies and other goodies. The meat option they have there (and sometimes at The Kitchen) also isn't unhealthy usually. Since the lines aren't long, I can get a pretty filling meal in one or two trips.  The great thing is that if I am tempted to overeat, I look around and see that everything else is like a diabetes factory and don't take more food. If anything, I'll just end up eating more broccoli or something. In other words, De Neve being largely awful for you is what actually keeps me disciplined. Based Nah the real strat is to attempt to eat healthy food at bplate while tracking your allowed 1200 calories on MyFitnessPal, in addition to working out at bfit every day. Eventually your will fails you so you binge and overeat at de neve, then you go 24-72 hours without eating anything and send cardio at bfit until your utter self disgust fades. Then you start the cycle over üòé Na- 4k calories my goal, I‚Äôll never cheat on Bplate Just because you overeat doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs unhealthy. You can be fat and still be healthy as long as ur not eating junk food. closeted bulemia You can‚Äôt be fat and healthy üò≠ Think you gotta get your terms straight there bucko https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1555137  ‚ÄúRelative to normal weight, being overweight was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality.‚Äù  Legit just had class today about this topic you are the stupidest person I have ever encountered. Imagine two people: both overeat but one overeats on pizza and shitty food while the other one overeats on chicken, rice, potatoes, nice healthy food.   They might both be chubby or fat, but the person who overeats on healthy food isn't going to be unhealthy. The person who eats shit is going to have visceral fat, that is fat that goes on the inside of your body which surronds your organ. I mean to be gruesome: look at autopsies of morbidly obese patients cut open and look at the fucking fat they have. That's fat you get from unhealthy food, not healthy food. I mean obese when I say fat Sure, but that‚Äôs not what the post is about at all. The post is saying they overeat the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù food, but don‚Äôt overeat when they eat ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù food. De Neve isn‚Äôt that unhealthy unless you‚Äôre getting pizza and burgers every meal, so it‚Äôs better than overeating at Bplate. If they overeat, then yes they will be unhealthy Tree Nut Allergy - Food on Campus Hi friends!  I am starving and forgot my lunch at home.

Do you know how many times I‚Äôve opened an unlocked bathroom door on campus just to make eye-contact with someone taking a shit? More than zero, which I‚Äôd say is too many fucking times. Locks are simple mechanisms, please learn to use them.

Why not? Except epicuria now üò≠ it does take swipes, isn't that even more convenient? oh thanks I didn't even know that Weird Roommate My roommate is being kinda crazy. Idk what to do. he keeps saying really weird and sexual stuff  and he thinks it's like a joke but idk it's weird Tell him that you are uncomfortable. People have different sensitivities, that's what she said. Perform ritual combat to decide who is in charge Sounds like a case of terminal internet poisoning. I recommend a treatment plan of at least an hour of grass touching every day. I don‚Äôt advice you to make it too much of a problem. He might think that it‚Äôs comfortable to talk like that with you. Just be honest and tell him that you‚Äôre uncomfortable listening that! If he didn‚Äôt respond, then take necessary action‚Ä¶ If you think ‚Äúhe thinks it‚Äôs like a joke‚Äù, then you don‚Äôt think that the talk will lead to any action. So, just tell him what he‚Äôs saying is too weird for you. Stop being a b**** and just tell him straight up. People out here never want to stand up, it ain‚Äôt hard to confront someone report to the RA Also consider contacting the title IX office even if you don't report it formally as an \"incident\" as they may have some suggestions for how to move forward. Can you document his antics in a tiktok series. I'm curious Perhaps his schizophrenia is coming to fruition?  Full blown schizophrenia manifest itself in young adults. stop being a bitch [removed] It's weird to you cuz you are an American talking everything personal. Y'all gotta realize life ain't that serious and notjojgis about you Orrr play chicken. Only way to know if he‚Äôs bluffing. RAs will take too long, just schedule a meeting with the RD! I concur doctor anything else you would like to add with your years of experience in the field? >  you need to stop thinking about yourself and think about him/they/it. what if your other roommate finds it funny?  By what right is another human entitled to make someone feel uncomfortable? If the roommate finds it funny, whatever the \"it\" is, this person should find someone other than the roommate to try their humor on. Lol do Americans take things too seriously? It sounds like you just only care about what inconveniences you and love being an asshole the rest of the time. You gotta realize a human is a sociopath or was raised without empathy, they would not spit out this incoherent drivel. Because they might not understand that they are making others uncomfortable. From the context of the post, it is not at all obvious that an exchange has taken place to let roommate know their jokes aren't appreciated. What kind of research can I do as a psychobio major ? Am I restricted to just psychology labs or will bio labs also consider me even tho my science coursework is kind of limited compared to regular bio majors Just apply. Major is not that important for labs. Second this, you can honestly apply to whatever labs your major rarely matters Advice on dropping an impacted class I'm planning on switching majors as the current one I'm in is making me miserable. Realistically It's not looking good for me getting a good grade in the class anyways so I'm thinking a W would be much better. How hard is it to do? Any advice is appreciated! You should talk to your professor and college advisor. But be prepared they only accept dropping of an impacted class for extenuating circumstances (and not liking or not having a good grade is not one of them). Just dropped once last week and you also need to provide documentation to prove your circumstances. Will I be able to enroll in Column A psych classes if I am still taking 100B? Silly question but my enrollment is today and I don‚Äôt know if I will be able to enroll in any Column A or B psych classes because I am still technically a Pre-major. I am currently taking 100B. All the Column A classes say prioritized for majors/juniors/seniors. Does this mean I will only be able to enroll in electives? You have to be declared to enroll first pass do you know if it‚Äôs the same for priority pass? if so that means i can‚Äôt get into the column a classes until i have finished 100b? Yes priority just means you get to enroll earlier. Psych is pretty unnaccomodating abt declaring and you have to finish all pre req classes before declaring. oof Physics 5B with Samani or Mehta? I need help deciding between the 2! I‚Äôve heard they both do weekly quizzes but when Mehta taught during covid he had weekly quizzes with no midterm and final‚Ä¶ do we think he will do this again? Samani doesn‚Äôt offer quiz corrections this quarter and the quizzes are rough. He is a passionate lecturer but the grading scale + quizzes are really tough. I loved Samani winter 2022. Check bruinwalk for updated ratings tho! i took 5b w samani during winter 2022 and passed w a B. he did weekly quizzes that were worth 60% i think, and he allowed you to submit quiz corrections, which could get you 1/3 of the points you missed back. my overall quiz grade was around a C but with the quiz corrections, it went to a b-, so they def helped. idk if he's still doing the corrections and such. i also remember he did weekly videos on top of the lectures. the videos were supposed to give you backgroud on the lectures for that week, so they were pretty helpful. samani has a thing were he dpoes like 30% research and 70% science education or something as part of his profesison. so he;s def passionate about what he teaches and he cares a lot for student learning. since we're fully in person now, I suspect quizzes are in person and so is the final. anyways, if you can take 5b w him, i suggest you go for it Has anyone taken any physics class with Mehta? And if so how was it?? Mehta is the antichrist How hard was his final in comparison to the quizzes? I have samani this quarter ü´† I am so curious as well! Does Samani allow equation sheets for his quizzes or does he provide the necessary equations on the quiz? I heard he does not allow equation sheets but I am wondering if this is only for the final or the quizzes as well? Fr I literally can't find anything on this man No equation sheets for the quizzes or the final unfortunately. Necessary equations are also not provided to you. RSU Group for 4bd/4pl (M) !!

Don't know where it goes, but it's only me and I walk alone. Ah ah, ah ah, I walk alone I walk alone. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I‚Äî I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. ‚Äî Robert Frost Looking to join a group for 4b/4p (f) Pm me please Looking For a Roommate for Early RSU (F)- De Neve Plaza Double Please message me if you are interested! How does DARS work Basically, the possible classes I can take for both my major and minor have a lot of overlap. When I take a class that could work for either, I just kinda \"assign\" it to one. Anyways, I know I have fulfilled all my major and minor requirements, but it doesn't show up that way on DARS because DARS I guess,,,arbitrarily makes certain classes fill requirements that I did not want them to fill.   Is there any way to fix this? Has anyone had this problem before? You can talk to your department advisor. They can manually make changes in DARS Thank you--I'm glad it can be done! swiping in at epic anyone know if you can swipe in a meal for yourself plus a meal for another person at epic at ackerman? ik you can do it at the dining halls but epic at ackerman always has a long line of ppl waiting so i wasn‚Äôt sure.

I lived w my s.o for a few months and was with them for about two years which isn‚Äôt a long time I know but everything about this situation was so crazy. And I know I‚Äôm not the best person in the world, but I tried to motivate him to go back To school, get a better job, create healthy habits, Plan dates, but he didn‚Äôt want to( it never came from him, or he never took initiative). Was I asking for a lot? I feel like I‚Äôm blaming myself for everything. And I hate myself so much for It. I know I have to Let go, because he saw me pack my bags and leave and now I feel so mentally fucked up during midterms/ Valentine‚Äôs Day. I‚Äôm Not okay. I know it‚Äôs not the end of the world, but I‚Äôm genuinely not okay. U were not asking for alot. From the sounds of it ur relationship was gonna fail as he was uninterested anymore or just lazy. In time you will see that u are better off. I mean my ex gf was emotionally and mentally abusive and it took me a bit to get over her. Just give it time and u will eventually see that he wasnt worth it Ms. girl, from what you're saying you were asking for the bare minimum. The unwanted but real answer is time. Everything just takes time. Your feelings will not just disappear overnight, and days like this might worsen the pain, but sometimes that's what is needed to grow. Try to keep yourself occupied through hobbies and activities that require some sort of brain power to where you don't start a spiral of thinking. Also try to motivate yourself to get back into good habits as well, dont let yourself fall too deeply out of line. Best of luck. Edit: just wanted to ask some college students bc I genuinely need some advice from ppl who are disciplined with more important things like school or family. What would you do? 2 years is a long time, congrats for sticking with it that long, you did well but it was time to move on. It takes half the time you dated them to get over them so you‚Äôll be over it in about a year. you should trust urself more. you left for a reason and you need to remind yourself of that reason. no one else‚Äôs opinions matter here. if he wasn‚Äôt enough for you then that‚Äôs that. if you weren‚Äôt happy then thats that. there‚Äôs no ‚Äònormal‚Äô for relationships because everyone is different. if it wasn‚Äôt for you it wasn‚Äôt for you and there‚Äôs nothing u can do about it. You wanted the bare minimum, dude refused to do even that. Better off without them. i dont allow myself moments to think because it will go thinking of my broken heart.... during midterms is rough :( but distraction until the wound has been closed up a bit is my key. If you work out a lot, you won't have the energy to think. The physical exhaustion can overcome all emotions Would love to support you on this!! I‚Äôm a very sensitive person and I had some very difficult things happen in my personal life around finals last quarter. I get physically ill from stress and anxiety that stems from interpersonal relationships so focusing on school was difficult.   It really helped, for me at least, to just focus on the life I wanted to live in the future. I‚Äôve started kinda living playing the bit- sorta like fake it till you make it, but focusing more on building the person you want to be and embodying that in your daily life.   At first it‚Äôs going to feel a little dissociative as you focus on what‚Äôs important to you, at least for me my brain was confused when I didn‚Äôt focus on anxiety anymore. But slowly you‚Äôll adapt and build yourself up again and you won‚Äôt feel disappointed because you were productive.  I‚Äôve usually dealt with stuff by absolutely burning out for like a week then getting my shit together, but this works better for me now :))   Hope that helps a little bit! And remember it‚Äôs good to ask people close to you for help. 14bl/14c/14cl together? hi! i'm just wondering if it is a terrible idea to take 14BL, 14C, & 14CL at the same time? Yeah, I took those three once and had to withdraw. Don‚Äôt take bl and cl together u will die from prelab/postlab busywork. Like neither class is very hard IMO but the busywork is hella frusterating 14CL is a shit show without having knowledge form 14C. Take 14C first and then CL If you want to lock yourself in a room and not enjoy life, then it‚Äôs okay do bl and c together and cl the following quarter From alcohol. how do you think enroll class(with petition) at this moment I dropped on week 3   and I hope to enroll in it again due to future plan. professor said okay.   and it's math upper class.  I think I have a time to follow up because I'm taking easy upper division courses. Bruh it‚Äôs week 6. You lost 3 weeks of class.

But he‚Äôs limping ‚òπÔ∏è  Would someone be able to take him to get checked? I‚Äôm not sure who takes care of powell cat The last contact I can find for the Campus Cat Network looks to have retired. I believe the person that runs the Powell Cat Instagram page is involved with them, though--try sending them a message! Where does this cat usually reside? Thanks! I contacted them today and they were able to contact the Campus Cat Network thankfully :)! I didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing lol. Not sure he kind of goes everywhere on the hill. But I think he frequents Saxon and Rendezvous the most. I saw him like around 9pm at Saxon today. Ah ok. Yeah I‚Äôd contact the school- see if someone will help take care of this cat. awesome thanks I‚Äôll do that :) Looking for 2 more roommates for off-campus apartment!

How good is Dinas Dumplings at feast was it good today It was good (you get 4 dumplings, slaw, and noodles or rice depending on the day). However, I waited an hour and 20 minutes to get my food (I‚Äôve never been to feast before so maybe that‚Äôs normal but that is the longest I‚Äôve ever waited on the hill to get food) so it was not worth the wait time imho it gets boring after awhile Who the hell is throwing a party on a Monday night?? FR we have midterms and people are out here partying and getting wasted?? FFS can‚Äôt you guys wait til the weekend? Some of us actually care about school and need to study. while you was getting laid I studied the blade lol good luck. My neighbors last year started partying around this time and then it was non-stop till the end of the school year. My walls were QUAKING Ikr loud parties are so freaking annoying when I'm trying to study. I managed to mostly resolve the issue with a white noise machine. You should get one, it's super helpful! It's great for blocking out noise when I'm trying to sleep too. nerd There are midterms going on weeks 3-7 non-virgins yknow the world actually does not stop when you have an assignment learn to live with it or to not study last minute ‚ô•Ô∏è you‚Äôre gonna need to learn that skill fr, take this as practice for the rest of your life What‚Äôs the problem? You can study in your room and not go to a party. No one is forcing you. don‚Äôt judge other peoples coping mechanisms smh While you were having premarital sex, I mastered the blockchain. Average Landfair enjoyer It‚Äôs still a school night. Dude, it‚Äôs actually illegal to be this noisy on a weeknight. I am not studying last minute. Everyone studies (or at least they should) the night before their midterm. Dude, it‚Äôs the noise. The noise interferes with my ability to study. It wasn‚Äôt even that. It‚Äôs just midterms are going on and people need to study. And now the barbarians are at the gate, and you have the audacity to come to me?

Don‚Äôt quote me on that though‚Äî Summer classes Will I get financial aid for 3 courses that adds up to 15 units during the summer? I‚Äôm confused because it says they can only give you aid for one summer program? And 1 is in A sesh and the other two in C. Yes you are going to get aid for the 15 units it‚Äôs just that your aid will just get divided within the 2 sessions :) and A and C are sessions in summer session (which is the summer program) thank you!

Jimi Hendrix ... Ackerman Union Ballroom UCLA - February 13, 1968  That‚Äôs awesome, he was pretty big at that time too My mom might have been at this show--I'll have to ask her!  All I can think about is how bad the sound must have been in there if you were anywhere except the front of the stage.   Another bit of trivia from music at that time and UCLA--Neil Young's \"The Needle and the Damage Done\" that ended up on *Harvest* and is the version that everyone knows was recorded at a concert at Royce Hall in 1971. That's fucking rad Easy Classes Any easy upper or lower divs? I‚Äôm a senior and I just need units to graduate and not ruin my gpa. February 13, 1968 ... The Jimi Hendrix Experience Experience performance at the Ackerman Ballroom at the University of California, Los Angeles. According to bassist Noel Redding, during the performance, the crowd rushes the stage.  Cool, Where can I find more UCLA music history? Imagine Bob Dylan sang on Royce Hall stage, R.E.M.¬†and¬†The Minutemen¬†played on the Ackerman Union patio and The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and¬†Sublime live on Bruin Walk...  https://newsroom.ucla.edu/magazine/rock-and-roll-music-history odd that they don't mention that the version of Neil Young's \"Needle and the Damage Done\" that ended up being released was recorded in concert at Royce Hall. Fuck Hendrix and the Minutemen played on campus??!??! I was born 20-30 years too late. If you know the Minutemen, have you ever heard of the band The Urinals? They were another punk band at the time, also on SST, but never really became as famous as others.   Anyway, they were UCLA students, and would play in punk shows on campus. One of the members actually also worked on campus! I found out he was in a band when I asked him what he did over the weekend once, and he said his band opened for Sonic Youth. I‚Äôll have to check them out. I was familiar with a lot of the punk/hardcore bands from the 80s but didn‚Äôt really discover The Minutemen outside of the Jackass theme until Covid. They are by far one of the most under appreciated rock bands on multiple levels in my opinion. I‚Äôll have to check out The Urinals later today. nice. Agreed on the Minutemen--so creative, and doing things no one else did or has done since then. I love that Mike Watt stayed in San Pedro and will just play shows at tiny clubs/bars anywhere, staying true to his roots.  For the Urinals, \"Ack Ack Ack Ack\" is probably their most well-known song, but I also really like \"Presence of Mind.\" A few of the members also had a later band called 100 Flowers. Check out \"California's Falling Into the Ocean\" by them. Microwave Anyone know if there is a microwave near Haines? Any soccer fans at UCLA wanna be friends on Valentines Day? Tomorrow is Valentines day but I really only care about PSG vs Bayern. I (20F) feel like I‚Äôm just gonna be single af forever watching soccer as a hobby in the US.

Looking for developers for startup Hi, I'm looking for developers to help me create an app! I can offer money or equity, if anybody is interested please dm me! (I can explain more about the project in pm's) Well, I think you can find qualified developers by posting on Reddit, but haven't you thought of working with special companies for that? I believe it can be more effective, and personally, I worked with a blockchain promotion agency [solus](https://b.solus.agency/) that also provided me with web development services, and as I know, they also help with technical implementation, so you can consider checking them out as well. Are you over 40? help cure midterm week bad vibes I am looking for people who are over 40 to recommend me albums. This is because i believe that the instant you cross the big four-oh barrier, it stops becoming cringe to spontaneously recommend music to strangers or tenuous acquaintance, and instead becomes kinda cool. So if you are over 40 (38 year olds need not apply, sorry, comment on this post in 2 years), give me your album recommendations.  I am posting this to r/ucla because i am a ucla student and its midterm season and honestly the despair vibes in the sub are kinda a downer rn, so some cool posts are in order.   i literally do not care about the genre. i will listen to anything, just help me (us all) get through midterms winter quarter is usually awful and a lot. it isn‚Äôt you. just a reminder. good luck with midterms and hang in there. Can‚Äôt you just apply this to every quarter? Life is hard dont blame the quarter. y‚Äôall are just weak.ü•± if u want, but whenever i ask people about the worst quarter for them it is usually winter. colder weather, sun sets earlier, end goal is smaller (spring break = one week), and things just seem busier overall. No shit but winter is the worst quarter of the three. For fall we all get that motivation for starting the new quarter strong, to meet our friends again, then look forward to our fall break. Winter we hardly get a break, are tried from fall, it‚Äôs grind time. Spring we‚Äôre gonna end school finally, many will graduate, the motivation to end is there because we will get a long summer break, some will get internships. Much to look forward to. Clearly winter is the worst one, Debbie downer. yep. even during zoom school when it‚Äôs a bit easier to go at your own pace with recordings, winter quarter is always shit Winter is just another quarter and is no different then others school seperated by breaks. If you look it as some terrible thing YOU will make it a terrible thing for self. By complaining this quarter sucks whatever u activaly make it worse for your self No rizz People dont want to be told to stay positive you can acknowledge what makes life harder and still have a net positive outlook dude That sucks but its the truth. People can rant and complain and i do it to. But the more you wallow the worse ur outlook will be so the more your wallow. If you want to have a better time start with a positive attitude I agree, complaining solves nothing To all seniors What classes are you all taking for your last spring quarter? I‚Äôm trying to take a class that doesn‚Äôt require much thinking and can‚Äôt think of any classes. LBR STD M108- taking it now it‚Äôs laid back Humid Tropics with Gillespie. Or forest ecosystems with Gillespie. Great professor and chill vibe!

Or is it at the front desk of wooden? It‚Äôs beginner friendly on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but the other days are a little more intense on the whiteboard in pardee looking for a MARINE BIO major to hold a class for me. I will pay if you are a marine bio major and can hold EEB109L for me, I will pay you. I'm a senior and about to graduate so I need a lab class to finish my requirements.   DM if your interested. TYY any cool places nearby to stay for a weekend trip? my dad is coming down next weekend before my birthday and we‚Äôre trying to figure out a cool/interesting area to go for a few days   seems like everything around here is mostly beach towns? which isn‚Äôt bad, but would prefer somewhere that has things to do on top of the beach Santa Barb/Ventura can be nice to checkout if you have a few days with no need to be in LA. I'd recommend checking out the observatories in LA, Dad's like those. Mt. Wilson is sick, but a long, cliffside drive (like it is going to any lookout point) but its like 15-20 miles of it. Burbank is an interesting area, maybe if he's interested in media/entertainment you could find something to tour there. There's also lacma, la brea tar pits, and a Car museum, and a theatre/media? museum near lacma, so he might find those things interesting as well.  bugatti museum in oxnard that's well worth but I think you need to book decently beforehand Does Bfit have a weighing scale/machine? If they do have one, where can I find it? And is it digital scale or a physician type scale? yeah it‚Äôs by the entrance They had both scales, but the digital one got damaged when it rained. The other one is still there. I think I‚Äôm blind because every time I enter Bfit, I never see it üò≠ Do I have to ask for it? Thanks for the information! Do you know if wooden has a digital scale? i dont think so, u just walk straight from the entrance area and it should be there Wooden does. Near the locker rooms, I believe. Thanks! I went today and found it! laundry on the hill is my personal hell im sorry but why the hell are half of the washers ALWAYS out of order?? either replace the washers or get more because no one truly has this much time to waste trying to do their laundry. not to mention how nasty some of y‚Äôall are üòê u kinda have to do laundry between 1 and 6 am unfortunately It is pretty fucked. Im surprised they've managed to get by with their situation for so long. It was just as awful 3 years ago. Too many people do their laundry at home, the caving is honestly embarrassing. Hi, speaking as a member of OCHC (we should definitely make a post here, too few people know about us). There is two main things that caused this situation. The first is that UCLA is a ginormous clumsy bureaucratic machine. The second is that Wash is quite honestly just a terrible contractor. Their customer support sucks, they hardly ever check work orders student submit through ucla portal, the machines are often older than it is even safe for an industrial washer/dryer (imagine, these things run almost 24/7 with too heavy of loads and yet many haven‚Äôt been replaced since 2015 or smth). The contract UCLA has with Wash doesn‚Äôt even mandate that there must be an x amount or percentage of machines running, so they hardly are motivated to fix them promptly. Well y‚Äôall would know of the many other problems Now why wouldn‚Äôt we change the provider? There are sensible reasons like the fact that it isn‚Äôt easy to find a provider who would deal with such a huge volume of machines. However, the main reason is that generations of students come, complain for a year or two and then go, while people in the management are in control of their tiny bit of UCLA life and rarely anyone has the full picture, so the contract gets resigned What can we do about it? Honestly, our best bet at overcoming this massive bureaucratic machine is to speak the language it understands: compile tangible proof that things simply aren‚Äôt alright. Every work order you guys submit is stored in the system and is a little proof that laundry is a problem. Every time you talk to your CR, they bring it to your OCHC rep and then it gets into OCHC meeting minutes is a little proof that Wash sucks. Last week at the Town Hall, we were collecting physical signatures of students who can vouch that they had beef with laundry. We, the students, come to the Hill and go but hopefully eventually this track record of evidence will make UCLA negotiate a better deal or change the provider In the meantime I have very few good news. Housing seems to understand more and more that this is an ongoing problem. Wash seems to understand that they could lose the deal and they promised 600 new machines this year. Even chancellor Block is now aware that we all struggle to simply wash our stuff. Hopefully, soon it will be enough just wait till you move to off campus apartments and the single washer being shared between multiple buildings is also always out of order I bought my own washer and dryer for the apartment Cuz i am so tired to this shit even in the apartments In my experience laundry has been pretty easy. If you can, try and do laundry in the early afternoon when most people are eating lunch or at class. I usually do my laundry Friday morning (between 9:30-11) and I have luck with it! I‚Äôm doing my last load at like 1-1:30 and that‚Äôs when it starts to get busy but I‚Äôm just waiting for my machines to be done I'm so glad I didnt chose to dorm at ucla. I really thought I was missing out on something..... clearly I'm living better üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ wow thank you so much for your response!!! I truly appreciate you taking the time to inform us about the work you all do and the work you‚Äôre doing to help improve the situation :D you guys should definitely make a post somewhere or something because this was great to hear and also really informative. again, thank you so much for taking the time to reply and I hope you have a great night!! maybe it‚Äôs just where I live because I‚Äôve tried all different hours of the day and there‚Äôs always a wait :,) thank you for the tip though!

My roommate and I are going to be interning from June-August in La over the summer. I sublet from a UCLA student last summer and had an amazing experience. I know it might be early, but if anyone is subletting a one-bedroom or studio this summer, please PM me! being a decent human to the two girls at the study today who didn't clean up after themselves and said \"we have janitors for a reason\" when confronted...why are u like this?  like the compost bins are right by the door on your way out... Freshmen? [girl power <3](https://twitter.com/reactjpg/status/1572091638507532288?s=46&t=xEjh-DO-0UJ8ChoJ10ZvYg) [deleted] [removed] ~fairly normal people who treat others kindly~ I've been to Memphis where people face real adversity, and those people are about 1000x more genuine and respectful ok snoo Who tf are you to say people at this have not faced real adversity? Just this week, one of my peers disclosed they‚Äôre facing issues of homelessness, and another one of my friend‚Äôs parent is literally fighting for their life in the hospital. People say on this sub daily how they‚Äôre dealing with mental and physical health issues, and how they‚Äôre struggling to keep their head above water. These students still show up to class and are invested in their education. These are the kinds of student that go to this school. A few bad apples, like those described by OP, don‚Äôt represent the entire student population. We‚Äôre all here trying our best.   ‚ÄúBe kind. For everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure someone else from another place can call your Memphis upbringing privileged as well, so where does that leave us? Just a circle of complaining and claiming your struggle is more ‚Äúreal‚Äù than others It's facts. Most kids here grew up in California and spent their entire childhoods in prep for Top Tier schools. Many of the kids who didn't grow up here, still went to special high schools to try to get here. Your peer can get housing through UCLA if they're at risk of homelessness. UCLA gives great financial help to students that don't even need it.   Students here struggle mentally at UCLA, because of the curriculum, and the location.   I'm sure everyone is doing their best.  But on average, most of you are painfully unaware of how your lives up until this point have been different than others, and most of you are too painfully focused on your own lives to be friendly to others. Is that where it leaves us? I'm pretty sure the only circle of complaining and unconsciously constantly being more aware of your struggles than others stems from the lack of conversation about it.   It seems obvious that UCLA students don't struggle as much as community college students. It seems obvious that UCLA students don't struggle as much as the homeless, or those who can't get degrees.   Despite that, UCLA students still constantly complain that their struggles are more \"real\" than others.   I'm pretty sure if we weren't so concerned with our own lives and struggles, the lives of those less fortunate than us would be better.   Complaining is an outdated term. Everyone's struggles are real, but some people's are worse. I agree that we shouldn‚Äôt have a struggle life contest, but it is way too broad for this thread to pretend like UCLA students don‚Äôt have issues. Sure, we go to school. But many students are still homeless, disabled, broke, lack family, have emotional issues, etc just like anybody from anywhere else. Is UCLA as an institution a privileged place to be? Sure. But not every student on an individual basis is some gold spoon using royalty. The original post is just about someone being annoyed that others won‚Äôt clean up after themselves, and people just wanting to trauma dump joined in saying ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you complain about? Well *I* have it worse.‚Äù Struggle competitions can be fine when they‚Äôre relevant I don't think thats what I'm saying. I'm talking in general.   The OP points out how ucla students CAN stink, yes?  (I think)..the comment that is now deleted pointed out that in their experience with UCLA students have been nothing but kind. UCLA students are unfortunately not nothing but kind, it is simply not true. There are UCLA students that are, but on average it certainly seems the case that people are unfriendly - as I said in my other comment.   I'm pretty sure the comment about memphis was just refuting the fact that people here at UCLA are perfect, and was making its own point. I don't know why it's gotten downvotes.  The comment that replied said, \"some people have feelings too\". Which is a no shit, and means nothing. It does not address the differences in struggle at all. The upvotes are shocking, and proof of the ignorance present at this school.  Struggle competitions are relevant when they're relevant, unfortunately the responder's comment that UCLA students are perfect was not relevant, and thats why they've deleted it.  Unfortunately, they're right as well. Real adversity is not people avoiding throwing away trash, and real adversity is not struggling with assignments at UCLA.

Hello,  I need to contact Professor Viyehni Fuchser, but he has not responded to my emails sent to [vfuchser@psych.ucla.edu](mailto:vfuchser@psych.ucla.edu). Is anyone currently taking a class with him or knows how I can contact him?  Thank you! He is very hard to contact I took an internship class with him and after I emailed him 3+ times I literally had to email the department itself to get in contact with him. At the end of the quarter I had to have my internship supervisor email him to confirm i completed my hours which she did before the deadline but he emailed me and my supervisor several weeks later angrily stating he would fail me if she didn‚Äôt confirm my hours and that he never received an email. My supervisor resent him the original email that was dated several week prior and he never responded to it. Do K or Wong R for Math 32A Which prof is better? Also does Do K record? I have Dr. Wong for the honors class, and my roommate has him for 32A right now. He‚Äôs a great professor and very lenient with grading imo. He gives you a lot of opportunities to learn the material and earn points/make revisions to your work. One downside though is that he does challenge you with some of the assignments, so you should expect to make an effort in his class. Do K does not record and doesn't use slides either. He writes on the whiteboard but the stuff he writes is basically identical to his notes which he posts at the end of each week  With that being said he is a nice prof and his class isn't too unreasonable Are dining hall nutrition labels accurate I feel like it‚Äôs so hard to count/ estimate calories because I don‚Äôt know whether I should believe what i see or not They should be fairly accurate, but more importantly focus on the serving/portion size. Otherwise nutrition labels won‚Äôt be so helpful. How much is a ‚Äúscoop of Mac & Cheese?‚Äù Or a ‚Äúbowl‚Äù of soup when the bowls might be different. It takes time in the beginning but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easy and second nature. Look up portion and serving sizes that compare to maybe the size of a fist, or things like that when it‚Äôs ambiguous. why did UCLA take away the cog sci minor? title ^ I always wondered why they just stopped offering it for people after class of 24‚Ä¶ was a reason ever provided  ? or was it just because they hate us I have no facts to back me up, but I think it might have to do with the broadness of cognitive science. Even with the major, which is a combination of multiple departments, you're taking a few psych classes, some more bio-y psych classes, a few coding ones, and a mix of things in your electives. So you're already not going very in depth for any field. With a minor, there'd be even fewer classes, like an intro class for every subject.My feeling is that people don't have the chance to learn enough about any particular field in the minor. there can only be one CS (Chicano studies) Probably because there were too many people yea Kinross Recreation Center How busy is the Kinross Recreation Center?   Are there cleaning stations within the gym to clean down the machines?   Can you access it with just your Bruin card? Or do you have to sign up separately?   Thanks for the help in answering my questions! Yeah they have multiple wipe dispensers or whatever they‚Äôre called to clean. They‚Äôre very on top of routinely disinfecting the machines. It‚Äôs usually really busy in the evenings but from 9a-3pish it‚Äôs usually not that busy and after 7:30ish. I would just call them and ask them how busy it is whenever you want to go. A con is you have to pay for parking (u could risk it or walk) and it may or may not be included in your masters program tuition. It just depends on your program so I‚Äôd call and ask Easy Writing 2 Classes What are some easy writing 2 classes I should take? English 4A Creative Writing! You do have to submit an application though (it‚Äôs only 250 words), and it‚Äôs a bit of a toss up what the class will be like since the professor changes each quarter. From my experience this quarter and my friend‚Äôs, who took it last quarter, the professors are really chill. One class period we even spent the first 20 minutes playing a game where we rolled each other across the room in our desks and chairs. Workload is a bit heavy for me since we‚Äôre writing 4-5 page stories every week, but I would honestly take that over essays any day. My friend had it even easier since her professor focused on poetry. disability studies 101 also super interesting class! Being a disabled student and why it matters I used to be such a good student. I had a 4.0 and I loved to learn. Then, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have for the past 5 years spent more time depressed than stable. I‚Äôve barely been able to keep up with classes since. I was accepted to ookla in 2020 as a transfer student and I still won‚Äôt be graduating until NEXT year because I‚Äôve had to start and stop so many times. I had to take this winter quarter off because I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed to go to class and now my spring enrollment time sucks. I dreamt of living on campus (I was homeschooled my entire life and always wanted the full ‚Äúexperience‚Äù) but had to move back home and become a commuter because my mental health was so bad. Even with CAE at my disposal, the system is not made for us.   So, why am I telling you all this?   **Fellow disabled friends: _we cannot give up_. We deserve to achieve our goals just as much as a traditional student. The way we go about it will be different. It may take longer and not go according to plan. But we deserve to be here just as much as every other student. On some days you may want so badly to give up but we have to remember that by not giving up on this goal we are making the system better for those who will follow in our footsteps. Do it for the disabled kid in high school right now who doesn‚Äôt think they could ever get into UCLA. Do it for the people who think disabled students drain too much money from the system. Don‚Äôt stop until you‚Äôre proud. EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO LEARN. You belong. You are important. You can do this.**  I look forward to the day I have diploma in hand and can say that I am the person I am today not _despite_ the challenges, but _because_ of them. Here‚Äôs to **equity** and **inclusion** üçªMay we all become better people for it. hey! fellow bipolar bruin! it feels impossible sometimes but i think we can both do it. thanks for the message :) Congratulations on your accomplishments in the face of such adversity! CAE was more strict with me than my Professor would‚Äôve been had I taken the exam in his class. They wouldn‚Äôt even phone down to my professor and ask a question I had‚Ä¶felt like a little detention center in there. Not at all what it is hyped up to be Fuck CAE. Rude as fuck staff. I feel you and relate. ü§ç I feel you fellow bruin! Congrats on everything you‚Äôve achieved so far ‚ù§Ô∏è this is exactly what i needed to see right now üíñ I love my disability specialist Natalia!!! but I agree with the other person who said that the exam proctoring sucked.   I had a midterm and there was freebie corrections + equations given in the lecture hall that everyone else got but I didn‚Äôt. I did appreciate the extra half hour but I just ended up taking the final not at the proctoring center bc I preferred to just be in the class for the ability to clarify questions, etc.  Accommodations are also great. I use Otter for like, every lecture (lol @ auditory processing issues). Priority enrollment is üî•.   Thank you for sharing this, everyone has their own journey and we shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed for not being ‚Äúas productive‚Äù as our peers or having to take time off. Best of luck to you in your future endeavors!! Thank you! Accidently shipped package to old campus dorm Title^  What will they do with my package if I don't live there anymore?

Does math 32b build up on knowledge from 32a?  Yes Also a prereq i think? UC Online Hey guys! Any thoughts on the UC Online classes offered from other UCs? What was your experience with these classes? Worth it or not? Can someone explain to me how I‚Äôm supposed to do well on ls7c midterms if I can‚Äôt understand the wording of the question I feel like I understand the content when u do clickers in class or do the practice questions but when the actual exam comes I end up doing terrible. Why do they word the questions on purpose so that we make mistakes do I have to print the content on the nside of my eyeballs or something to do well? LS7C is like that‚Ä¶ I would use process of elimination, if anything else. If you can, ask questions. Don‚Äôt ask for the answer, but usually TA‚Äôs and profs will be clarifying on any questions you have. Imagine testing for understanding of the material when you can just make the exams illegible, then drag the midterm over 2 weeks, so half the time in the class is exam season. Don‚Äôt forget to require reading guides to be due before class each week so you need to do all the homework over the weekend! Yeah no I totally think the way they try to trip you up on wording is wrong.   What helped me was going to office hours (especially after midterms) and seeing how the TAs and profs would explain the wording of questions, so you can understand *their* definition of it. And pay attention to words like \"always\" and \"sometimes\" and those sorts of things. something i found helpful was going to the problem solving sessions. they explain the systems in the way you need to know it for the test Exactly! Why tf do they have to make everything so much harder than it needs to be? Whoever designed this class is going straight to hell. All UCLA classes: do you have esdin?? This is hilarious, I‚Äôm sure they get this complaint every year because I took 7A and 7C in freshman year. I‚Äôm now a senior so I guess nothings changed. I‚Äôm sorry about that :( I always feel like I do well on the exams because my answer makes sense but then I get my score back and i bomb the exam so I‚Äôm a little confused on whether they‚Äôre trying to test my ability to decode questions or actually knowing the content yk? Ok thanks! I heard if you can rearrange the question to make it make more sense it‚Äôs typically false but ofc I found that out after I took it üíÄ Whoever created the exams are not ever seeing the gates of heaven Yep It‚Äôs been like this every quarter and nothing ever changes :( I do think they curve the class at the end tho bc the last two quarters there was no way I should have gotten a good grade with my test scores That might be why they hide final scores, so they can pretend that they didn‚Äôt curve. They 100% curved the last 2 quarters because I most definitely didn‚Äôt ace the final üíÄ for engineering majors, can tech breadth courses be taken p/np?  No My day is complete  Ordered it today. Can confirm it's good Has anyone ever gotten the message from USPS that a package was picked up by an individual from the post office when they were trying to ship to the dorms? I‚Äôm worried it means someone else got my package and it won‚Äôt ever get to the dorms. Any information would help. no i‚Äôm pretty sure it always says that for USPS when delivered to the hill So I‚Äôve asked about this before, and usually in this specific case it means that it has left the major post office in Brentwood/another larger USPS office to go to a smaller one that covers UCLA. i have !! happened to me fall quarter and i got super worried but it ultimately got to me thru the mailroom. you should be okay. Bruin card center printing Can anyone who works there or is planning to go there at 1pm or went there at 11am today let me know if the printers for printing the Bruincards are back up? Switching to Engineering Dilemma I'm switching from L&S to Engineering at the end of winter quarter (hopefully). During spring quarter I would like to take CS31, however, I cannot enroll because I don't have the engineering status yet in MyUCLA. I have contacted the instructor, but no response yet. Any suggestions? You'll be able to enroll when restrictions drop. They also accept basically everybody who fills out the interest survey. I have never heard of anybody not getting CS 31 when they wanted it. OLYMPIC CAT!!!

Some days I only have one lecture so it feels like a robbery to pay $7 for 1h and 15 min.   I usually park in structure 7 and I‚Äôm curious on how they check? It‚Äôs so big and there aren‚Äôt any scanners? How likely am I to get a ticket? Also, how much is a ticket? They have parking enforcement cars with license plate scanners that drive around. They‚Äôre pretty diligent about ticketing so I‚Äôd recommend parking elsewhere in Westwood if you don‚Äôt want to pay. There are usually spots on Veteran and Kelton throughout the day, if you don‚Äôt mind walking a bit that‚Äôs a good option Tickets are minimum $70 if I‚Äôm remembering correctly   Also, use the app SpotAngels to find free parking around Westwood. You‚Äôre gonna have to walk a bit, but there‚Äôs plenty of places depending on time of day.   I live a half hour walk to school and there‚Äôs free parking everywhere, but you gotta get there early There are [LPR (license plate recognition) cameras](https://imgur.com/a/VEpCnya) in Structure 7 mounted on the roof over each of the entrance and exit lanes, you can‚Äôt see them when you‚Äôre driving in because they‚Äôre behind a beam and aimed at the lanes where the gates used to be so they can scan your rear plate when you drive in and out of the structure. That being said, some parking structures (3 and 4) let you pay by the hour ($3/hour) instead of forcing you to pay for a whole day like you do in structure 7. you could get a quarterly parking pass? it would cost less than paying $7 a day The Ralphs parking lot has 2 hour free parking with validation. Maybe do hourly for the short class? I think it‚Äôs like 4/hr?

Note: I‚Äôm a pretty terrible standardized test taker unless it‚Äôs open note midterms/finals. Take home format would be nice. Also I would prefer the most chill/approachable Professor as well.  Thanks! Lofchie is a pretty easy A too, just two papers that were 3 pages long I think Lofchie describes himself as a ‚Äúmush grader!‚Äù The class is based off two short essays and attendance and you can do pretty well on them just by attending lecture and maybe skimming the reading. prof perry was a free A in both classes i took with him I took PS20 with perry and it was an easy A, idk about that upper div specifically though. Lofchie based that upper div on a midterm and final when I took him  PS139 has a heavy reading/writing workload. He makes it clear on the first day of class that if that‚Äôs not your style, you should drop. The course itself is relatively interesting, but definitely not ‚Äúeasy‚Äù subject matter by any means. He‚Äôs a nice guy and very understanding though, seemed to be a pretty light grader too if it‚Äôs clear you thoroughly researched your assignments is there a reason why his ratings are pretty low? genuinely curious thanks! ohh so there‚Äôs no standardized midterm/final? when did you take Lofchie? Like 10 page midterm & 15 page precis? I‚Äôd probably say it‚Äôs because he likes to go on tangents and his readings sometimes aren‚Äôt that relevant to the matter discussed. One thing I didn‚Äôt like though is used very minimal slides with not that much information so you have to really pay attention during lecture. I will say though I stopped reading the last few weeks and did fine. I also do think I was supposed to get an A- but when he put in my grade he boosted me up to an A. Good luck! Yeah, something like that. This is on top of like 4 or 5 mini papers (3 pages each I think) based on the readings due throughout the quarter as well. what a guy! Thanks for your detailed insight! I see thanks! Ofc! Feel free to DM me if you have any more questions Fire trucks in front of sproul Anyone know why there were a ton of fire trucks earlier?

I‚Äôll be abroad in fall and am looking for someone who‚Äôs going abroad winter/spring to switch off housing w me/sublet to me! open to a double or single in university or private apartments :) Summer housing and food Do people stay on campus or in apartments during summer? Is the food bad? Are plazas available or just classic/deluxes? as someone who did a summer session last year i guess i‚Äôm qualified to answer this lmao.   -whether you‚Äôre in a dorm or apartment is personal choice. my understanding is that summer housing will offer you a deluxe dorm. however, sometimes people will sublet apartments if they find someone who is leaving over the summer.   -food: at the time, only de neve was open. feast at rieber also served food but it was basically the same menu as de neve.   -dorms: my understanding is that only the deluxe dorms will be open but that‚Äôs just my experience so take that with a grain of salt lol.   also disclaimer, a lot of hs students are on the hill over the summer so be prepared for the vibe to be much different. it felt kinda isolating being on the hill for six weeks but it‚Äôs not too bad if you focus on classes and maybe find a friend who is also a returning student haha GroupMe for 527/540 Midvale? Anyone in 527/540 Midvale, is there a GroupMe? And if so I‚Äôd appreciate the link üôè I live here and would love to know the answer to that Can I request RSU at this moment?

This for female only housing. The other two roommates would be in the double. I‚Äôm a Latina (Mexican) third year female undergraduate student.

I regularly workout and I also watch anime and listen to different types of music! Please let me know if anyone is interested! UCLA Housing RSU Roomate group eligibility for seniors I'm a rising senior and am currently living in off-campus housing; however I regret this and now want to revert to on-campus housing (university apartments). My roommate group all have access to early RSU except me, because they are all undergraduate returners (lived in university apartments this year); however, since I am not technically an undergraduate returner my housing status says that I‚Äôm a lottery undergraduate. Is it possible for me to still join my roommate group in any way if they‚Äôre all RSU except me? Thank you! My friend is in exactly the same situation and we cannot add them into our group;((( For now I only know that lottery applicants need to be assigned in the same room type to get assigned with the same dorm as we do, but lmk if there‚Äôs any other updates!

For you gamers out there: UCLA Webinar on Korean History and Europa Universalis IV    Dr.¬†√Ålvaro Sanz from Paradox Tinto Studios, joined by Sixiang Wang (UCLA), will discuss how the award-winning computer game, *Europa Universalis IV* (2013-present), have approached the simulation of Korean history and East Asian diplomatic institutions during the game's development. They will discuss a range of topics including: how Paradox Studios conducts historical research, how the game tries to model historical agency through player choices in the game, how the game addresses the challenge of representing diplomatic institutions that fall outside of modern \"nation-state\" conventions. They will also address the ethics of simulation: what does it mean when a player can be a king, colonizer, or empire builder; the theoretical implication of \"what if\" histories; and how the game developers have managed the problem of Eurocentrism, especially in its representation of Korea and East Asia. The discussion between the panelists will be followed by an open Q&A period.

Has anyone taken two undergraduate research positions before? I've currently taken a position that is relatively light at the moment, and just got a paid offer from another lab. Is it possible to manage two labs? has anyone done this before? and if so can you please give me some insight? Thanks Don‚Äôt do it, you lose sight of what you learn and it‚Äôs hard to keep up. It‚Äôs one of my regrets and I wish I was more committed to one of my labs than stay in 2 it's possible if your total employment (from all jobs) is less than 50% FTE (ie <20hrs/week) if you want to stay enrolled as a full time student. you can figure out what your FTE is based on your offer letter. whether or not you **should** do both is up to you and will depend a lot on what your other commitments are, your goals, etc. good luck! I've never been in a lab, but I've heard pretty much universally from my professors, peers, advisors, etc. that it's not a good idea at all. I'm in 2 labs rn and tbh it's only possible if one of them has a lesser workload than the other. One of mine has me coming in 2 days per week for half a day each and writing scientific texts while the other has kinda taken a back burner due to inactivity from the PI. If the other one suddenly amps up activity idk how I'd be able to handle having both labs at once Off campus apt (smoking roommates for next year) If my roommates smoke outside only and we have our own rooms, do you think that the smell will still be very strong in the apt? One of my roomies smokes on our balcony and it permeates the whole living room lol Depends on how close they smoke and what they do after. My parents smoke outside away from the house and wash their hands when they come in and I can only smell it when i hug them Feast menu I‚Äôve noticed that everything on the menu says it‚Äôs prepared with alcohol. Like literally every single day, every menu option, even the taiyaki. Does anyone know if they ever have any options that aren‚Äôt prepped with alcohol? Like I doubt that every single dish they make uses alcohol, but I went to go ask the people working at the front at feast a little while ago and even they aren‚Äôt sure. I just wanted to know because I can‚Äôt consume any alcohol for religious reasons and their menu options look so good but I haven‚Äôt been able to try anything from there Since the menu changes every week it‚Äôs hard for the staff to really be sure how they‚Äôre preparing the food. It all really depends on which food truck is there that week so don‚Äôt be discouraged! I‚Äôm pretty sure that the truck that‚Äôs going to be here this week, Dina‚Äôs dumplings, doesn‚Äôt prep with alcohol u can always ask the ppl at the front desk if you can go and ask the chef whether there‚Äôs alcohol in the food before you swipe in! i do it every time i go to feast to check for allergens and they always let me do it, u just have to give them ur bruincard to keep while u ask The ‚Äúvegetarian‚Äù options also always say they have fish oil lol head start on CS 33 & CS 35L I would like to do as much as I can to prepare before taking 33 and 35L next quarter.   Could former students of these classes walk me through things I should get started on? What will I be using in CS 35L, Ubuntu? GitHub? How much of Python/C/other languages should I get familiar with?  And wth is a malloc?  Thanks!! The best way to get a head start for CS35L is to familiarize yourself with linux and Emacs. Here‚Äôs a link to the LA readings: https://github.com/NingWang1729/Introduction-to-Software-Construction 33 is not too bad, the material is very dense but as long as you don‚Äôt fall behind, you‚Äôll be okay. Also they got rid of the malloc lab so you don‚Äôt have to worry about that anymore.    35L is hard because Eggert doesn‚Äôt cover the stuff you need for the hw. E.g. he‚Äôll cover 5% of emacs, then expect you do google the rest. If possible, you can try to get started on the hws now as they can be a huge time sink. Pretty sure his hws are the same every quarter. The final project is highly group dependent, pray that you end up with ppl with full stack experience‚Ä¶.   ETA: all 35l course material can be found on eggert‚Äôs site, tells you exactly what languages and what assignments you need to do CS33 really doesn‚Äôt require much pre-studying, there‚Äôs not much you could easily teach yourself anyway. For CS35L, you could try familiarizing yourself with Linux BASH, Emacs, and React. The projects are a mix of scripting in python and linux, and ReactJS applications. The final project tends to be done in ReactJS, so learning how to make a basic web app would be helpful. Thanks so much, that‚Äôs really helpful!!

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I would do the same if I had premium üòÇ. There's an option to use your swipes ahead of time? If you have premium are they not loaded on at the start of the quarter? Or only at the start of the week?  Either way people who have excess are the only issue with the queues so only they need to use them up throughout the quarter Facts. You're correct premium gets loaded up at the start of the quarter. From what I remember we couldn't swipe \"days ahead\" ~persay~  and reserve a meal, if that makes sense.   The benefit of premium during my time was that you get to eat more than 2-3 meals per day if you need, and you don't just lose a meal if you didn't eat it that day.   I'm not sure people with access to premium are the only reason for the queues, I've seen the queues get worse and worse over the past few years. I'd imagine regular users are worse because they have to get their meal at the time otherwise they lose it.   Regardless IMO It's either a covid thing or a population thing- I think most waits for things in general have grown in correlation with population/crowding recently. There are more people on sidewalks, more people in grocery stores, more people in parking lots, more people going anywhere than I've seen ever in the last year.  Against my point is the fact that US population hasn't really increased, its bellowing out.   This is because we are near our carrying capacity though, so we are essentially full wether we think there could be more of a population or not. So yeah we're full and it's the first time we've ever been so full and hit such a full state so rapidly. Crazy time to be alive, onlestly. The queues are only an issue on week 9 and 10 when everyones trying to use up their excess swipes so it is only premium people Looking for on-campus RSU group(m) My time is 3/6 at 1pm.

I wanted to tell them they‚Äôre very good looking but :( I don‚Äôt have the guts to approach ppl here especially as a woman. Whoever you are!! You‚Äôre very beautiful!!!! Because all the not hot ones go to Berkeley Sheer numbers?  Plus, being hot gives you an advantage in life... I can't help but wonder if being hot gave people more confidence to do well in school and extracurriculars. sry‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs LA. and hot people want to go to LA Maybe cuz it's warm and people are showing more skin? They don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a lot of people, you just notice the hot onesüóø  money Dude most people here are not hot in the slightest 3 possible reasons:  A) most people here are from wealthy families, so they have more money/time to spend making themselves hot  B) being hot gives you advantages in life that make it easier to get into UCLA  C) bc you're here <333 ! Of the people who apply, and the ones who get in, and the ones who chose to come, there is probably a mindset that is commonly founded in the students. Not only that, because so many people are attractive, many more follow to fit in.   Also, having a higher income rate helps too. Because global warming I have good looking parents plus I've been going to the gym for 4 years Everyone except me Well, most hot people are in radio TBH. Humans are mammals, and mammals are endothermic.    Covid's helping, too Same Really? Common sense Daddy Block raised the average Who are they r/UCLAmissedconnections More confidence means you do better in school, extracurriculars, and gives you an advantage in life, which makes you hot for women. This is actually 100% valid 1000% yes. If ur not hot on ur insta profile, the uc system will send u to Cal instead Now I know, why I went to cal How many in each RSU time slot?

Now every time I see scooters in the way I drag them to the side‚Äî they can be a pain to move when they‚Äôre locked, but it only takes a minute and it could prevent someone from getting seriously hurt.  So if y‚Äôall ever see scooters in the way like this, pls drag them over if you can. It can really help students who use white canes, wheelchairs, etc. And then you get to feel good about yourself so it‚Äôs a win-win! üôè This shit pisses me off so bad.

UCLA's stated policies for for establishing residency can be found [here](https://registrar.ucla.edu/fees-residence/residence-requirements/classification-as-a-resident#:~:text=Students%20must%20be%20continuously%20physically,the%20first%20day%20of%20classes).).  However, much of this information is either incomplete or highly misleading.  This includes:  * Unlisted deadlines for obtaining residency documents (CA license, certified voter reg card, etc).  For example, many students applying for residency in fall 2022 reported being denied on the ground of missing a Dec 2021 deadline.  Not only was this not clearly provided, but... * False information is given during orientation events and individual meetings with UCLA residence deputies.  In the Dec deadline example, students were specifically told at grad orientation that they would have the entire year to obtain residency documents (i.e. no Dec 2021 deadline).  This was apparently reiterated to several students directly by residence deputies as well. * Deceptive policies that suggest exceptions for extraordinary circumstances (family circumstances, out-of-state work/research, etc), when in reality, those rules are firmly enforced.  In my specific case, I was absent from CA for slightly over 6 weeks this past summer due in large part to a family medical situation.  (The 6 week maximum absence requirement is not directly listed on the UCLA website).  I've been preemptively told that I will be denied residency for fall, winter, and spring quarters of this year because of this.  UCLA staff told me that I need to appeal my residency determination to UC, only for UC to tell me that residency determinations made by UCLA are final.  At no point was either party actually willing to entertain any possibility of extraordinary circumstances.  And even if you are successful in your appeal, UC takes 10-12 weeks to process them.  So, for example, if you want to appeal your determination for fall quarter, you will likely be on the hook for nonresident tuition during both fall and winter quarter (~$10k) before you hear your final determination.  Moreover, despite extensive feedback from graduate students during the strike this fall about the lack of transparency and accurate information during the process of establishing residency, UCLA has still refused to update their website to provide this information.  It's frankly hard not to see this as deliberately deceptive at this point.  In short, if you will be financially reliant on establishing residency to afford tuition during your second year onward, you should know that it is far from guaranteed even if you make reasonable efforts to meet their stated requirements.  And if you do decide to come, do not take anything UCLA says at face value.  Place much more weight on the [UC's website](https://www.ucop.edu/residency/index.html).  And verify everything with current students and make no assumptions about how policies will be enforced.  Best of luck. Is this just for lower school fees?

Just wanted to know how the electrical engineering department is doing at UCLA and if you guys would recommend it or not. The EE dept is really great at UCLA. I'm a graduate student here rn. The professors are pretty chill, the courses that they offer are amazing and the department has a lot of funding as well. would say i'm vibing :') i enjoy the classes a lot I transferred last Fall, and I've enjoyed it so far, most of the professors take their jobs seriously, and other students have been great. The only thing that's sucked for me is the massive hit to my ego, as I've scored below average on pretty much every test. The tests don't feel *that* much harder, but it never feels like you have enough time. I'm sure it's not hard for other people, but it was a bit of a shock for me. I transferred here in the fall from a CC. So far my experience has been good. Exams are tough, but the curve always hooks it up at the end of the quarter. I‚Äôd say the TA‚Äôs in general are really good, and if you can take 102 with Kao. You‚Äôll get to experience one of the best lecturers I. The department I would recommend Berkeley or UCSD over UCLA. Especially EECS at Berkeley. Ucsd and cal have more graduates in stem and have a stronger alumni presence in the tech industry.  But other than that, the classes here are good. I personally would not recommend. Dang supporting Cal on r/ucla? Yep. Look up the rankings. Cal (and sometimes ucsd, depending on the source) is objectively better for engineering. the faculty to research output ratio is way better at UCLA than both of those. absolute value yeah UCSD has more publications but they also have like 3-4 times more faculty Yes, because usnews rankings are the definitive measure of educational quality of course it does lead to small sample bias (UCSB has the highest ratio but they have almost no faculty) Are people upset they didn‚Äôt get in or something? Or is it the silly rivalry? I mean I wish I got in too. But here we are.   Berkeley EECS is widely known to be the best in the world. Sorry but those are the facts. Do some research and you‚Äôll see (starting salary, recruitment, prestige, academia, etc.) Not gonna spend anymore time on this. Kaufman hall to public affairs Is it possible to get from Kaufman hall to public affairs in 10 mins? i used to get to pub aff from boelter in 10 minutes  just walk fast Master of applied chemical sciences Any thoughts/experience about the master of applied chemical sciences offered by the department of Chemistry? Is it worth the money? ^ wondering the same UCLA graduate school age Hello everyone!  I am a female international student and am finishing with my BSc in Biological Chemistry in September this year. I am currently 22 years old and will turn 23 by the end of this year. Unfortunately I have missed the application deadlines for the graduate program starting this year in autumn. I am thinking about applying this year and then starting next year, in autumn 2024. Next year I will be 23, almost 24 at the time I would start graduate school. I am having doubts about my age as I might be perceived as \"too old\".  I have many questions about that topic.  (1) How old is the average UCLA graduate student? (2) Is there any way to shorten your PHD studies at UCLA?  (3) Can you get accepted into a PHD program without going through the whole application process by already having a potential supervisor that is willing to sponsor you/ accepts you to his group? (4) How long does it approximately take to finish your PHD?  I am also hesitating about applying for graduate school in the US as I would like to start a family in my late 20s and am worried that the PHD program might not \"allow\" me to take maternity leave. (5) Does anyone have any experience in that regard? (6) Or any suggestions which universities in the US might be a better fit for me?  It would mean the world to me if you could take the time to answer some of my questions.Thank you so much! 1. Depends on masters vs PhD. Some PhD students will be older due to having a masters or taking a gap year to work etc. Nobody will care about you being one year ‚Äútoo old‚Äù. 2. You graduate when your PI says so. If you publish enough papers, then you will be more likely to graduate early. It also depends on your lab, where some labs graduate students much faster than others. 3. Yes. For biology grad students, you will rotate through several labs during your first year before picking one to stay for the rest of your studies.  4. This is highly dependent on your lab. 5 years is about average at my lab. 5. UCLA allows 6 weeks, but your PI may give you more flexibility. https://grad.ucla.edu/funding/working-at-ucla/childbirth-accommodation-funding/ I graduated my biochem BS at UCLA a year late due to some personal circumstances that caused me to withdraw for a year. I don‚Äôt have the exact answers for questions 1-4 but I can shed some light on 5.   I was 26 when I decided I wanted to pursue a whole new field and enrolled in a second bachelor‚Äôs program. The average age of that class? 28. I thought I would be on the older side but we had so many people in their 40s and 50s!   I got married as a masters student and had my first child at 32 when I was a doctoral student. I took two semesters off to accommodate a part of pregnancy and maternity leave. It was super common to have pregnant classmates! At graduation we had baby bumps and one classmate even walked across the stage to be hooded while holding their child. Granted, that was professional school in a healthcare field so it may differ from a PhD since I was paying tuition out of my own pocket.   An older acquaintance of mine actually had her child right before quals for her chemistry PhD, pursued her MBA, then came back to defend her chemistry PhD. Ages vary wildly. A number of people go back to school (myself included) after working. Noone cares. 1) ages vary wildly but you will not be unusually old (at all) if you‚Äôre starting at 24. Many people take years off and start in late 20s, early 30s. 2) the duration of your PHD will depend on your specific research and your advisor. In general I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs done the combined masters/PhD faster than 4.5 years. 3) no, you still have to get accepted to the program you want to graduate from. 4) this will entirely depend on your program and research specifically. Generally, 5-7years total.  5) as a ucla grad student employee (either a TA or a researcher) you have Union protections of your right to healthcare, including maternity care, and paid parental leave when your child is born, and even support for childcare costs. You cannot be made to leave your program for having a child mid-degree. You will be MUCH better off in that regard at a unionized school like the UCs than a school without unionized grad students. You'll see 22 year olds gawk at the senility of the 25 years olds. The age difference is as apparent as a 12-month old vs a 4 year old. One of the PhD candidates in the math department was in his mid-to-late thirties when he began and then went to Princeton for his post-doc. I guarantee you, no one will care how old you are.  It sucks that your supervisor is pressuring you to finish as soon as possible! That must be stressful. It's also strange to me because there's been some professors I've spoken to and master's/PhD candidates I'm friends with who have either encouraged their students to take time off from school or have been encouraged by their advisors to take time off from school. One of my friends is at MIT and was encouraged by his advisor -- who is a huge name in the field, his advisor wrote one of the most widely read textbooks in his field -- to spend a year working outside of academia before beginning his PhD. Granted, he did encourage my friend to spend that year working in a lab doing relevant research -- but in general this advisor actually has a decent track record for encouraging his students to take time off for other reasons too!   Regarding starting a family, I think most people just wait until they finish their PhD to start a family. If you really wanted to, you could talk to whatever university you're at about taking a quarter or a semester or an entire year off from your studies when you have your first child. In the US, PhD candidates are usually funded directly by their home department instead of their PI/advisor (unless you get outside funding, like an NSF grant) so you'd have to ask the department to take time off; there was a PhD candidate in the UCLA math department who took a quarter off to intern at Amazon. You won't get any funding during that time, but it probably wouldn't be too hard to come back as long as you were in good standing with the department and your PI/advisor at the time you left! That PhD candidate came back the following quarter and is still here, finishing up his dissertation. It would definitely have to be a thing you discuss well in advance with your department though.  Since a PhD is usually a 5 year commitment (or more) in the US you might wanna consider going to the UK instead? Because in the UK you usually first enroll in a master's program and then enroll in a PhD program and this combined is usually 4 years. That would probably be the fastest way to get everything done as soon as possible...  Good luck either way! Not sure if masters programs are different but the average age at the law school is 24-25. Wouldn‚Äôt worry about it Age is basically irrelevant for graduate admissions No one will care.  Grad student in my department just finished at 40-41.  South campus. I don‚Äôt think age is important. >Thank you so much for your answer!    >   >Regarding (3) I still don't quite understand if I will need to apply for the graduate PHD program through the online application portal? Or if it is possible to just get accepted into the program by knowing a professor at UCLA that is willing to take/sponsor you directly? I am sorry if the questions might sound redundant, but I am not familiar with the US system as I have completed my studies in Switzerland. (ETH) Thank you so much for sharing your story! Very inspiring! I feel like at my current university there is so much pressure on students to rush through their studies! I once talked to my supervisor about taking a semester off and he answered that it would be such a pity to loose half a year and that I should try to finish my studies ASAP in order to be a competitive candidate in either academia or industry later in life!   Also the educational system in the life sciences doesn't make it very easy for women to combine their studies with family planning which makes me even more stressed. I don't know if you have experienced similar problems... I am sending you a dm regarding some of your other questions Thanks for taking the time to reply to my questions!   I did consider going to the UK but unfortunately the UK is not part of the EU anymore (since Brexit) and I would need to pay a lot of money for getting my master's and PHD there, as both programs are not funded by the university! I also think it wouldn't do too much harm to take off a year after finishing my undergraduate and then focussing on getting some experience in research prior to committing to a joint master/PHD program. Is it 5 years or more for joint master/PHD or only for the PHD at UCLA? You still need to apply. Having a professor who wants you as a student just means if you are rejected by the committee, the professor can ask for you to be accepted instead. thanks! just saw the message now :) joint! Thanks! Very kind of you that you took the time to reply to my questions :) You‚Äôre welcome. Good luck with your applications! i made a day in the life video! would be cool if u guys could check it out :)  Thought advertising isn't allowed on Reddit Awesome! I won‚Äôt be watching rising senior (asian, male) looking for rsu group (4bd/4p ua) i'm usually quiet and like to keep to myself (that is, unless we click super well). i also like to keep clean and be civil.   i'm literally just trying to finish my degree and to get out. you probably won't even notice that i'm there at times (as my current roommates have mentioned, which i guess is a plus?)  - dont smoke, prefer not to live with smokers - not a drinker, prefer not to live with drinkers - no guests in our room (unless notified) - put things away as we use them - sleep b/t 10pm and midnight - wake up b/t 8am and 10am - tv and music are off while studying - tv and music are off while sleeping - preferred room temperature: warm  send a dm if interested!  edit: philosophy major from the sgv!  edit 2: also, i'm down to form a group. but please, dm if your preferences truly align... Dm‚Äôd u What's sgv? I can‚Äôt I cannot bring myself to do the 28652 assignments that‚Äôs due next week. In fact I gave up on my last hw. And also I‚Äôve been missing class  I just want to lay in bed and not think about school‚Ä¶ How do people do this Been feeling the same  I hate winter quarter i really feel this, you‚Äôre not alone. i feel a lot of the time people at ucla everyone is doing really good and able to handle everything. it‚Äôs really isolating to be surrounded by everyone doing ‚Äúwell‚Äù and feeling like you can‚Äôt get it right. stay strong though, i‚Äôm rooting for you. you can take things one step at a time. same oh my god my ass is getting beat so badly rn   what is helping me is to tackle things little by little. i am really trying not to look at the big picture because then i will get overwhelmed & shut down & not do anything-- so i tell myself to complete one assignment & i don't think about what comes after that until i'm done. I have 500 pages of reading left for a midterm tmr, a HW & an essay (both of which I haven‚Äôt started) due tonight & a midterm on wed‚Ä¶I‚Äôve no clue how I‚Äôm getting through all this, but I believe I can, and so should you One day at a time. You got this buddy I did this, i gave up and just laid in my bed. It got very boring after a few hours and i got back to work Same. I‚Äôve missed classes, skipped hanging with friends, and pushed my luck to the extreme with requesting extensions for assignments. Sometimes it feels like my entire life is teetering on the ends of collapse. If you want my advice, just take a day, do something relaxing without worrying about school, and then get a lot of sleep. Wipe the slate clean and start again in the morning. This isn‚Äôt the end of the world, you‚Äôre going to be okay. Talk to your teachers and tell them what you said. Some of them might be nice and will give you until the end of the quarter to turn in assignments. Then you can sorta reset your clock, set up a schedule, and finish your assignments without feeling as overwhelmed. You might not get an a in every class, but you‚Äôll do a decent job in at least some of your classes. Life is an absurd potato 40 more days till spring break, you can do this üí™üí™ you should try the pomodoro technique‚Ä¶  is not what i‚Äôm going to tell you   there is in fact a much more effective study method that has been hacked by research.   i do not speak of the spacing effect, time blocking, or flow state (although you should try a few of those).   instead i suggest the ultra-secret technique that is better than pomodoro: [animedoro](https://youtu.be/bUjGZJIgse0) Take a break!   It's easy to get caught up the loop of \"I've got to do this, and this, and this, let's go  go go.\"  Don't forget that breaks are mandatory! You're human, not a robot, and every human has a limit.   If you don't then you run the risk of burnout... which is what it sounds like you're experiencing.   &#x200B;  Sincerely,   A senior that took far too long to figure this out. Get up and move. It's tough, but hang in there ‚ù§Ô∏è You‚Äôre not alone. Me too ü•∫ Me too:( reallllly struggling to do anything not just assignments I‚Äôve been there too OP. I don‚Äôt hear people talk about it enough but the truth is College is hard. Instead of giving advice I‚Äôm just going to say that how you‚Äôre feeling is very real and I hope you feel a little better and are able to get up and take a shower or go get something to eat. Sending you all my love. Also a song that makes me really happy and something I put on when I‚Äôm feeling low is Somewhere Over the Rainbow by Israel Kamakawiwo‚Äôole. üåàüíï Same. I am the most burnt-out I have ever been.   I just try to plan little things for myself that I know I will enjoy later so I can look forward to them. I tell myself \"ok once I finish this assignment, I get to \\[go to my pedicure/watch a movie/go to the park\\]\" and it kinda makes the time go by faster for me. literally me asf potato girl You need some aderall,,,, lol Stop being so dramatic, it's just school. You're not going into the coal mines. Winter quarter SADs Learn from this one and take less units next time or change habits What major? Ikr I'm so freaking exhausted and I'm so sick of having to take ungodly amounts of caffeine to keep up with my assignments and exams The lofi youtube channel is pretty good. i'm in the same boat. rooting for you OP. why is this word for word how i‚Äôve felt for 5 weeks is this a winter quarter thing? this is my first year here & winter quarter has been kicking my ass despite me adjusting really well during fall quarter ü•≤ü•≤ Same I'm trying to take everything one step at a time Same but I have my phone with me in my bed so I just watch YouTube, Netflix, etc.. and time runs out till it‚Äôs bedtime and then repeat üò™ 40?! Okay, this made me feel worse üò© That's not helping Dunno why this is downvoted!  Put one step in front of the next and get moving In the same position. Fall quarter was nice and chill but winter quarter is massively kicking my ass Personally, I definitely feel like it‚Äôs a winter thing. When I ask people which quarter they like the least, they tend to say winter quarter. The weather is the most dreary and the sun sets early. And there are also less things that are going on, whereas Fall and Spring have lots of fun events and better weather. Winter quarter is a just a slog to get through ü•≤ I hope your spring goes better! Definitely a winter quarter thing!  I transferred last year and experienced the same thing fall was easy and doable and then boom winter came and it was hell üò≠ and I‚Äôm experiencing this again this year too lol it can be a thing... sometimes you'll be killing it one quarter and then the next the quarter will be killing you. Winter is kinda the worst for this one because of the cloudy weather and SAD probably. Sorry üòÇ Yeah plus winter quarter is like the middle of the sandwich. In fall you still have energy left from summer and the promise of winter break ahead. In spring you‚Äôre looking forward to summer. In the winter you only have a medium break behind you and a super short one ahead :( Hows spring Hmm am I the only one who actually likes the weather during winter quarter? It's nice having a change of pace for once. And I get to wear my cozy hoodies! Imo spring is the fastest. Honestly can‚Äôt remember how it feels when you‚Äôre in it because it just kind of flashed by last year as someone from a cold hometown, i like the colder days to space out the warmer ones (: RSU chances of getting a 2bed/3ppl Hiiii I have a early RSU time of 10AM on 03/07. Does anyone know if it‚Äôs possible to get a 2bed/3ppl apartment in Glenrock/Westwood palms/Glenrock west by then? I heard that these rooms gets occupied pretty fast but I‚Äôm not sure how fast it would be.   Any insight will be really appreciated!! Also curious to see how quickly the 4 bed/4person one fills up if anybody has experience last year FYI: there‚Äôs a whole day of RSU times starting at 8am the day before on the 6th there aren‚Äôt a lot of 4/4 units compared to the other units i honestly think they‚Äôre gonna run out within the first few hours. Last year they weren‚Äôt as popular tbh. This year everyone wants it. Are these for faculties? do you know how fast the 3/2 went last year? Do you know when the very first time slot is for early? I have a pretty early one but not sure students 3/6 8am is the earliest tome How do they able to get time before 3/6? no, I‚Äôm saying peoples times start at 3/6 thx!! do you know how fast 2 bedroom 3 occupancy went last year?

A very nice individual asked me if I could watch their phone while they left it to charge at the table I was sitting at. They said they were just over there (motioned to a cubby seating area) and would be back for it. About 30 minutes later I finished up my work and was ready to leave, but I wanted to make sure this person got their phone back.  I didn't remember where they sat and I hardly remembered what they looked like, I was pretty into my book that I didn't make a mental note. I thought about going up to people and asking to see if it was their phone but honestly I wasn't sure what to do. There were two other students sitting at my table and I asked if they would be okay to watch the phone until the person came back so I could leave. They agreed and I moved the phone near them so it wouldn't get stolen.  TLDR: I hope whoever was charging their phone got it back! The two people I left it with were very gracious to keep watch over it, and thank you for that. I didn't even check to see if there was a bruincard on the back which might help me identify the owner. I'm sure they came back for it and were able to get it after it was charged, but I had been thinking about it all week and I'm very sorry if my leaving gave you concern. That's a lot of trust to place in somebody Aren't there any closer charging ports with seats they could've used if it's night powell? Possibly, but it seemed they didn't have a wall plug for their USB so they came over to the table. Math 33A chengxiwang Does anyone have practice midterm for math 33a with wang?

If my roommate moves out for spring quarter, will I get a new roommate? Basically title, they‚Äôre studying abroad so I‚Äôll be alone in a 1 bedroom, 2 person uni apartment. if there is an exchange program or room swap happening during spring quarter, chances are probably yes housing will shove someone new in there. but you could get lucky and have the room to yourself Yes they will fill it up, one of our roommates decided to cancel and within a week they found someone potentially, but i got lucky last year and actually had the room to myself for the entirety of spring quarter I live in a off campus UA with an international exchange someone who left after the fall quarter. Still no replacement Single pods question Can you store stuff in the common room?  I love using my living room in my suite to have amenities (TV, keyboard, etc), but in all the videos of single pods, the common room looks very empty.  Is it too dangerous (someone will tamper with ur stuff) to have shared amenities in the common room??  I‚Äôm in a suite rn and I‚Äôm maybe interested in a single pod next year Thanks It depends on ur situation. If all ur suit mates r friendly and are nice then ya it isn‚Äôt a problem but typically we never talked to each other and didn‚Äôt wanna be a bother so we never put any thing out  Also the other suitmates sometimes leave the door dead bolted which can cause random people to come into the common area and have things stolen Our suite was super friendly and we all hung out in the common room all the time. We decorated for every holiday, celebrated every birthday, etc. We kept a nightstand with a TV in there and stored games and party supplies in the drawers. Someone kept a scooter in there and someone else kept their vacuum in there so we could share it. We also had boxes in the corners where we could put stuff we didn‚Äôt want in them like food and clothes and others could take them sort of like a communal cabinet. We shared responsibility for cleaning the room on a voluntary basis. Someone would vacuum when they vacuumed their room, and they‚Äôd wipe the table after eating and stuff like that. But yeah, if you put effort into making everyone friends like start a groupme for everyone and ask them to eat meals together for the first few days then yeah, it‚Äôs safe to keep things in there.

You apply for full-year housing, and they‚Äôll terminate your contract for that semester. You can send them an email and they‚Äôll take care of it. Sent you a pm! (: Do you like your major? What's that like? I don't think I've ever actually liked my major classes, at best I've been ambivalent towards them. They're a ton of work and most are really boring. All the classes I enjoyed were part of other majors and I wish I was doing something else with my life. At least I'm almost done but I wish I had chosen to do something else when I started.  For those of you who like what you're studying, why? What do you like about it? What's it like to enjoy your chosen career? I find my major enjoyable, exciting, and thrilling. I feel passionate about it. I find my homework fun and recreational (so long as I‚Äôm not stressed with deadlines). I find some if not most lecture material leaves me in shock and awe like a good movie or an incredible song.   I do have times where stress overwhelms the excitement and there are sometimes month long or quarter long periods where I forget why I‚Äôm doing what I‚Äôm doing and forget to appreciate what I‚Äôm learning and enjoy it. Eventually, I‚Äôll end up thinking about it again and renew my love for my major though. Meh, but I‚Äôd rather do math hw than write essays ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø You're a fellow engineering major, right? I assume you're doing your major because of money/parents then? I started off wanting to do classics or art, but I chose EE for financial security. Now that I'm a senior, I've found that my major is objectively fascinating and it has become my passion. I think engineering is objectively cool when you see how genius some of the designs we study are and much we contribute to civilization. Electrical is extra cool because of two reasons: 1) E&M physics is fascinating, and 2) hardware and low level programming is very cool because it's like having to speak a different language.  I agree that Mech E is more boring which is why I'm not a Mech E major, but have you ever considered shopping around the school of engineering? What basic sciences did you like as a high schooler? If you find bio more interesting, you can check out biomedical engineering; if you like linguistics, maybe consider CS with natural language processing? I would encourage you to do what you like deep-down, but I understand the reality of having to find a job after graduation (RIP classics major dreams), so the best option might be a compromise.   Yes we have to haul ass, but I try to take pride in that and see it as building work ethic. Also at the end of the day, being an academic is still much easier than working 8+ hours a day of manual labor, which is what some people who don't even have the chance to study at a place at UCLA do. I majored in Computer Science and Economics. I really enjoyed most of my computer science classes. I already knew before college that I liked things like polymorphism and inheritance, so I was not disappointed with the theory in classes like CS 131. While many of the classes were work-intensive, I largely enjoyed the lecture material. There were very few classes that I did not enjoy the material; mostly it was a dislike of the teaching style of the professor. Even classes that I came in expecting to be ambivalent about I ended up with at least a moderate interest by the end of the class. I appear to be very lucky in that regard. The career options were also very straightforward - become a Software Engineer.  Econ was slightly different. I doubled in Econ because I enjoyed an econ class I took during high school, and wanted more of the same (macro/micro economic theory). I enjoyed the introductory courses (11, 101, 102), and discovered econometrics to be fairly interesting (perhaps I should have been a stats major instead), but really disliked Economic Forecasting (Econ 144). Since Econ was not my intended career path, the \"practical\" courses like 104 and 144 (which I took with Rojas) were uninteresting and difficult (and I really hate Rojas' teaching style). I am very glad I did not enter as an Econ major. It took me a lottt of exploration but I have discovered I am super passionate about my major and would like to keep it. The classes are challenging, but I get excited thinking about my future career :) I really enjoy it because I am exposed to different classes in my lower division classes (different disciplines) that also really interest me. You‚Äôve got this! I'm EE and I love a subset of my major classes (optics, semiconductors, digital logic, signal processing) but I hate analog circuits. Biology was the easiest thing I had done thanks to Covid. I didn‚Äôt go to a single lecture last two years, and I aced every class nice it was all open book.  I spent most of my time working, researching and doing things I liked. Downside was that I couldn‚Äôt do everything because Covid. I'm majoring in Financial Actuarial Math, and I absolutely love it. The major encompasses math, econ, and statistics in insurance. The classes are challenging, yes, but they translate quite well to the insurance and finance world. I will say, though, upper divs while more difficult, are much more enjoyable than lower divs since you're taking classes that are more specific and useful. So if you're an underclassman, then I recommend you be a little patient and try to explore student orgs that align with your passions instead. (Also echoing another comment, I'd rather sit down and pull my hair doing math homework than pull my hair writing papers, as the latter would also include self-doubt, tears, and an existential crisis.) I'm a cognitive science major. I don't really have a passion in cog sci, but I like my major. It is one of the majors that offer you the largest freedom in course selections. The courseload is not heavy (But you can definitiely make it heavy by enrolling in more courses), so I have time to explore my interest. I'm actually really interested in software engineering, but I didn't changed my major to CS since I don't wanna take physics classes and I still want to take some psych courses. Majored in Classics, loved it. It allowed me to study something I love while working towards working in Games, which is what I wanted to do after graduation and am now doing! I found studying what I‚Äôm passionate in made my college experience engaging and fun (not to say it wasn‚Äôt difficult). It was definitely rewarding. I studied what I loved and went into something else I love! Game Dev! You like biology? You won‚Äôt after my major. ü§£ I‚Äôm an econ major and an exchange student. Back home I loved my major, mix of theory and math. Here it‚Äôs 90% math and I hate it but the memory of how it can be is worth me sticking with it. Some classes here aren‚Äôt too math based though and if any other econ majors have any suggestions lmk Love my major üòçüòç That sounds really nice. What's your major? I'm just doing this cuz I was good at math and science in high school. If I didn't colossally fuck up my transition to college I maybe would have switched to aerospace. Aerospace engineering actually makes me feel something close to passion, which is more than I can say for mechanical. I'm EE and M51A has been my favorite CS class that I've taken so far. The professor is not very good, and that is a bit of an understatement, but I've been able to learn the material on YouTube and have actually found it fun‚Äîthe problems are like a puzzle. Most of the classes I enjoyed were different disciplines, upper divs are kinda boring. Even my capstone has been like 90% busywork bullshit so far. pure mathematics üòáü•∞ Aren't ME and AE in the same department and pretty related? I hope you can still pursue aerospace internships and jobs with your degree. oh really! it says you are a mech e major. Do u like it? I‚Äôm a psych major and the upper divs also sound very interesting. No I hate it. It's boring and nothing I could possibly do in  the future will matter. I can't make any friends in the major cuz everyone looks down on me cuz I'm stupid and talk too much in social situations. I'm just finishing it out cuz at least I'll maybe get ok money once I find a job. Looking for 1 bedroom/private room walking distance to campus.  Latina looking for roommates for a 4p/4b UA. Hi I‚Äôm a (20) female Latina who Is currently looking for roommates for a 4/4 university apartment. A little bit about me im a psychobiology major from the Central Valley and am Mexican.

Foreign Language requirement grading Can one take all their language classes for p/np or does it have to be a letter grade?  I.e French 1, 2 and 3 all p/np pretty sure you have to take at least level 3 for a letter grade because it‚Äôs a major requirement looking for past RA's! hi! I was wondering if any RA or past RA would be down to talk to me ab their experience and what to expect from the group interview process. pls feel free to dm me or comment belowww! ty!!! i‚Äôd rllly like to know as well! is it a bad idea to wash my giant plushie in a laundry machine on the hill idk how else to clean it üò≠ It would not be the greatest idea. How big is it? Is the cover removable (is there a zipper anywhere?) for washing? From what I remember the machines on the hill are all front loaders and not very large. If you shove it in whole then the stuffing will likely become lumpy and matted and it would be extremely hard to dry thoroughly. Most of these giant plushies are spot clean only for structural integrity and huggability after cleaning. Are there any washing instructions on the tag? I usually stick to those. Like for my squishmallow, it tells me to put it in a pillowcase and machine wash cold, then tumble dry on low. It comes out perfectly fine after washing and drying. Depending on the plushie material though, you might want to try something different. tyty for your help! it‚Äôs about the size of a school backpack w no zipper. just not sure what‚Äôs the best way to go about cleaning it bc my friend used it on the floor as pillow after a night out lol so it‚Äôs pretty dirty all around It would be best to vacuum it first with the hose attachment and a soft brush, then spot clean with some gentle detergent or OxiClean. That's what I do with the stuffed animals my kids love. Ones they don't care about as much go in the washing machine, but still on the gentle cycle. Math 115A/AH discussion sections How mandatory/helpful are the discussion sections for Math 115A or 115AH and upper level math courses? I saw that Paul Balmer is teaching 115AH for the spring quarter. I have a 9-5 (but flexible) job with some meetings during the day (want to take some math classes through the concurrent enrollment program), so the less I have to go to in person classes the better.  Background: I have taken the equivalent of 33A and 61 (and perhaps 95) in college. Alright Bruins, what is one meal you‚Äôve cooked for yourself? I understand many students like to dine-in, takeout, and microwave their food, but if you‚Äôve made something appetizing feel free to share!  For example, since I live off-campus, I‚Äôve made steak tacos for myself. caldo de pollo Fried rice is good and easy There should be a bruin cooking club fr chicken alfredo Curry. Cheap and easy to make. Plus can be stored for a while Ceviche which is super easy to make and there are various kinds of them. The most popular is the shrimp one. All you have to do is peel and boil the shrimp to your liking. You then mince tomatoes, onion, and chile serrano, chop some cilantro, grate carrot, and mix it all together. Once that is done, add the shrimp to the bowl and add bunch of lime (I like to add around 3) and season with salt and pepper. You usually eat this with tostadas, valentina/tapatio. I always make broccoli/green beans, steamed rice; and some variation of meat either ribeye steak, salmon, chicken, bulgogi, spicy pork, etc nearly every night. I usually make pasta with turkey meat sauce but I‚Äôve made chickpea salad too. [almond crusted salmon](https://gimmedelicious.com/15-minute-crunchy-lemon-almond-crusted-salmon/) with lemon slices (to squeeze onto the salmon) with jasmine rice and [air fryer broccoli](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/air-fryer-broccoli/)  pretty lowkey, easy to make, yummy Carne guisada and homemade tortillas.      A+, strong recommend. Share recipes too?? made teriyaki chicken rice today and turned out great. Usually would make a giant pot of bolognese sauce with as much meat and vegetables as possible so I can keep my lazy ass healthy for a week. Sliced hot links with cucumber and mushroom with lots of garlic Tofu and bok choy stir fry Probably not the healthiest but I make that once a week üòã the lime also cooks the shrimp as well right? recipe? i‚Äôve had ground turkey in my freezer for a month because i can‚Äôt come up with a good way to cook it!! yes thats correct! But personally, I just prefer to boil the shrimp so its fully cooked and add the lime so it tastes better. Dude I just a jar of pasta sauce and spices haha. oh boo i never like that jar sauce Jarred sauce can be good. You just have to get the right one. looking for an RSU group hi there, I (20f) am looking for an RSU group to either join or create for the university apartments for next year (my timeslot is march 6th 8:15 am) and I am hoping to get a 2b/3p or 4b/4p configuration because I would ideally prefer a single room but I‚Äôd still like to be close to the people I‚Äôm living with.   I‚Äôm originally from Maryland and now live in Cape Cod, MA, and I‚Äôm a cognitive science major hoping to minor in linguistics or a foreign language. I love the outdoors and am involved in board club, backpacking club, and Club climbing team here at UCLA! I‚Äôm part of the creative collective LLC right now and love music and art; I crochet and knit in my free time. I also love trying new foods, thrifting, and exploring LA in general! It would be awesome if we had some of the same interests in common.   I‚Äôm super excited to make the apartment feel like a home and I love cooking so I‚Äôm excited to make meals as well! Please reach out to me if you are interested and would like to chat or even meet up. :) Hi! I‚Äôm also looking to get a single room next year in the apartments and don‚Äôt have a RSU group yet.

I use the Tick Tick app as a calendar for literally everything, with alerts 5 min - 30 min - 1 hour - 1 day before the event. For lectures, discussions, assignment deadlines, club meetings, little reminders (e.g. move car for street sweeping!!).  It‚Äôs been super helpful to be able to physically see the things I have coming up and I‚Äôm less likely to forget little things if I just really quickly add it as a task.    I still struggle with time anxiety + time blindness but less now that I have the app. It‚Äôs better than physical planners for me, I always bought those and never managed to use them consistently. Alprazolam Tetley, milk, sugar.  PG Tips is acceptable, but inferior. Thank you for sharing this! I definitely have time blindness as well. I‚Äôll try this out. This needs some explanation Forsure!

I didn‚Äôt find it to be too difficult at all Wooden spoon rant I know I might get some hate for this, but it must be said: I cannot stand the wooden spoons and forks at rendez :(.  Their shape don‚Äôt feel right, they taste a little too much like wood, and I feel like eating with them has been a bit more difficult and less satisfying.  Furthermore, I would like to say that I am all for the environment and understand how we should be moving forward in avoiding single use plastic. I know that wood cutlery is a better alternative to plastic and I commend ucla dining for trying to do their part.  Before any of you naysayers comment, I would like you to know that I will start using a set of reusable cutlery.  Edit: Yes, this is shallow of me to say-I know. And like I said earlier, wood is the better alternative!! I‚Äôm not saying that we should go back to plastic, in fact‚ÄìI agree this is an impressive environmentally conscious decision on ucla dining‚Äôs part!! Ngl lie I thought you were talking about spoons at the John Wooden Center I thought someone was spooning in wooden Kind of tastes like the wooden sticks in H√§agen-Dazs ice cream bars Fr, i was tryna eat chicken noodles soup with the wooden spoons at bcaf and it just didnt hit the same Oh damn are they not using those faux-plastic compostable utensils anymore? Those were great, I love the idea of composting a fork. First world problem if I‚Äôve ever seen one good on you pretty sure switching to reusable will be better than single use wood environmentally speaking & taste wise They tried reusable cutlery but it all got stolen.  They had metal sets even at the Bomb Shelter.  I think it lasted a few months...  ...If you don't like the taste, don't suck on it? Oh lord i think it's way better and environmentally conscious than using like plastic It gives me flashbacks to my days its literally just a fork... bring ur own if ur that upset?? Fr I thought they were calling me out Exquisite taste Unfortunately those utensils weren‚Äôt actually being composted. How those utensils work is that they‚Äôre shipped to a facility where they‚Äôre set at a specific temperature/condition in which they‚Äôre able to be industrially composted. Unfortunately, the specific type of compostable plastic UCLA had been using isn‚Äôt compatible with the facility it‚Äôs being sent to, so it can be assumed those utensils ended up in the landfill. Greenwashing on UCLA‚Äôs part.  Source: I know someone from SAR (Sustainability Action Research) Bro be sucking on more than his food That‚Äôs a shame, I‚Äôm still proud that they‚Äôre trying to be more environmentally conscious though!

Study methods for engineering Hi,  I‚Äôm having trouble finding the best way to study to learn how to better problem solve when it comes to classes like thermodynamics and fluids.  How do you guys usually study? Like reading the chapter, watching YouTube videos or going through the class notes? I feel like lectures don‚Äôt help as much when it comes to homework. I just want to maximize productivity with the time I have to do homework    Thank you! C: So as I am more of a lurker than a commenter my comment might not mean much but here goes. Also just wanna mention Im a much older student than most at UCLA so my methods might not be the most optimized or efficient!   Getting to the topic, one thing that I know that helps me study or focus is my putting myself in an environment or situation where I know I will be able to focus. This could be a library or cafe alone but definitely never inside my room.   For more concrete study forms, I don‚Äôt think of myself as the most intelligent nor hard working, but when I must I have some study techniques.   1. Try to start from where you DO understand. What lectures and concepts can you confidently say you understand? Start from there.  2. Give yourself lots of time. Don‚Äôt try to cram but study a little a day. Break down lectures into days and make sure to only focus on those concepts.  3. If you don‚Äôt know something, break it down. Start from what is the definition of this concept. What is it for? How is it used? For every word or point you get lost, go into that detail and come back up after. Get to the core of it. As you do this, the next concept will be easier as your previous foundations will be stronger.  4. Lastly, when you study, try to make notes or organize a notebook for that class and try to take notes as if youre writing your own textbook. Try to write it in ways where you want someone else to know what you‚Äôre trying to portray. Really, imagine if youre trying to explain this concept to someone who has no idea what it is. If your handwriting doesnt seem clean then rewrite it. The repetition helps with memorization too.   I understand these techniques might not be actual techniques or what youre looking for but I hope it helps. I also know Im not the most efficient or optimized at studying but thats why I give myself days to study so I can do it in a way I understand.   Basically, try various methods and see what works! Sorry this wasnt much help but hang in there! We‚Äôre all just trying out best to make it out there! Take notes and go over them later. Ask questions to yourself. Wonder why things are. Test your understanding. Study before you sleep or workout. I‚Äôm in fluids rn and I kind of look at lecture at an intro to what I should study that night. The textbook is kind of dense so I only look over it to clarify the equations and variables, and look at their worked examples. After class I‚Äôll go home and watch Dr Biddle‚Äôs lecture series on YouTube for that topic and try to do the Hw or a few practice problems if I have time. There‚Äôs also plenty of videos that have worked examples which I think is super helpful to getting familiar with how to approach the problems. I also make sure to attend both TA office hours if I can, even if I only have one or two questions. Wow thank you so much this is great! definitely helps out a lot!! Really have to study before I workout haha can‚Äôt think straight after a workout Can we be friends üò≠ you‚Äôre so determined, I took fluids last quarter and i wish i could‚Äôve done a lot better because it was rough but definitely manageable!

Are Math 156/164 uniquely different than anything in the CS department? I'm considering taking a Math minor as a CS major ... the path of 115A -> 131A -> 170A -> 164 -> 156 and I'm trying to decide if it's worth my time. I'd still like to take 115A -> 131A -> 170A, but it's mainly the last two. I'm wondering if I should take some other Maths or if 156/164 teach anything that's very applicable to CS and would be useful and interesting for me to know.  I am interested in Math, but I want to make sure I use my classes wisely. do the guitar classes at the rec center require you have/bring your own guitar? i don't own a guitar but it seems like fun; would like to try it out before actually comitting to buying one the teacher has a few spares i believe! How do you sign up for these? Has anyone gone through the UCLA psychological services? How was your experience? I am looking into seeing a therapist through UCLA but want to know if it‚Äôs worth the discount or if I should find a therapist not affiliated with UCLA. i have tried both CAPS therapy and a psychologist unaffiliated with UCLA.   the main difference is the treatment plan. CAPS is a short-term service where you only get 8 sessions (4 per quarter). you cannot choose your therapist and some are licensed while others are trainees. i got a trainer which meant our sessions were recorded. the recordings are deleted a day later and only viewed by supervisors.   if you‚Äôve never tried therapy before and you start with CAPS, it might be a bit disappointing that you only get 4 sessions especially if you make a good connection with your therapist. when the limit is reached, they can refer you to outside therapy. i was quite desperate so i settled for a trainee instead of a licensed psychologist so the experience might be a bit different. the main difference is a few more years of training and experience. other than that, most of therapy is listening and asking questions. so overall, CAPS is for short-term treatment.   as for outside therapy, i saw a psychologist for two years way before i started at UCLA. i had never tried therapy before and it was a very strange experience at first. barely talked the first session but gradually warmed up to them as time went on. for outside therapy, you can choose who you want to see so there are oodles of options. this can also make it more overwhelming for some people.   but of course the biggest difference between CAPS and non-CAPS is the cost. if you browse through psychology today, you‚Äôll find that psychotherapy can range anywhere from $90 to $350 per session. it is not cheap.   both have helped me in different ways. CAPS provided me with a space to reflect and vent while outside therapy gave me a more structured approach. you might want to try CAPS first and see how that goes. the cost of psychological services is a massive problem and it is unfortunate that it isn‚Äôt as accessible as it should be. i have also tried online therapy and while not as effective (it lacked the in-person interaction), it‚Äôs always an option.   hope this helps :) going to go against the grain here; i went to CAPS a few years ago and it was pretty awful. my therapist kind of pigeonholed me into a box based on cultural stereotypes and i didn't feel very heard; it just felt like she was pattern matching against stereotypes. she'd also try to cut sessions short which didn't make me feel great. CAPS is fine if you need a place to vent quickly but i would strongly recommend against them for actual therapy I personally had a great experience with CAPS - my therapist was surprisingly spot on with many of her observations regarding me, what I thought about myself, issues I had with anxiety, self esteem, etc.  Going through CAPS first is definitely more convenient than trying to navigate the hell that is finding a therapist on your own and hoping they take your insurance. You can also schedule an appointment at CAPS with an employee there who will help you figure out which therapists in the area will take your insurance, which is also super nice! I personally relied on referrals from my CAPS therapist and found one I liked and still see today, 3.5 years later. Once you get the on-boarding call out of the way (essentially they just ask you why you‚Äôre wanting therapy), they give you the option to give you a referral to an in-network therapist that you can choose with a $0 co-pay. So I opted for that and then used this platform called, PATH, which allows you to search for nearby therapists based on your insurance AND preferences. Once you create you‚Äôre account and they verify everything, you can easily just pick your therapist and meet with them. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done and it‚Äôs worked wonders for me! Plus the good thing about the referral is that it lasts for 1 year so you have plenty of time instead of the short-term experience with CAPS If you have USHIP even non-CAPS therapy is $0 per session, max once a week I have therapy through a CAPS affiliate - BHS and it‚Äôs been pretty good so far What did you get therapy for? anxiety disorder The very thing i am now facing cool Easiest L&S Diversity Courses What are the easiest diversity courses for L&S? film tv 4 is a super easy and fun class that fulfills the L&S diversity req.

I released this song recently for valentines day! lmk what you think:)  [https://open.spotify.com/track/0lWF10Ub60acoodL7QnWoz?si=de8aebe0e9dc4616](https://open.spotify.com/track/0lWF10Ub60acoodL7QnWoz?si=de8aebe0e9dc4616) the music library has open jam sessions on friday afternoons, i'd get in touch with them What resources do you want? You can perform for free in most outdoor public spaces. Is taking Math 134 and Math 135 together a good option? I tried taking 142 before Math134 and Math135 then realized that was a terrible idea and now am planning on taking them both together next quarter. What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts on taking them together. I took them both together and there was actually a lot of crossover between the 2. One crossover in particular was Picard‚Äôs theorem. However that crossover became confusing as Picard‚Äôs theorem was used differently and for each class and had different wording and conditions. It got jumbled in my head and I ended up with a B in 134 and a D in 135. My personal recommendation is to take 134 first and then 135. Either way, don‚Äôt take 135 with Shiba. I retook it with Wu and I literally knew everything and passed easily with an A. Shiba ran the class like it was a graduate level course. I knew enough to get an A the first time. She just made it super unnecessarily difficult. I just wanna second not taking 135 with shiba. I took it with her and when everyone failed both midterms, she blamed it on us and lectured us about needing to try harder (despite the fact that she had typos on the exam that made problems unsolvable). I beat the curves on all the exams and still didn‚Äôt get an A because of how harsh she was with grading in the end right?? she was insane. She was actually okay for 134 though so idk what went on in 135. Parking Enforcement on Kelton 2/11 Parking enforcement is marking cars at the top of Kelton Ave, will come back and check them later today. bro the way i didn‚Äôt see this post in time Good looks üëÄ UCSB, UCLA or UC Berkley for my Year abroad? I have just confirmed my year abroad to a UC Campus from the UK, but I can't choose between these three options. UCLA seems problematic when not having a car regarding travelling to nearby areas, plus I heard there is a lot of sorority culture. UC Berkley is perfect for a career in consulting but I'm sceptical about the colder weather and the competitive atmosphere. While UCSB seems like a lot of fun but does not have the prestige of the other two. What would you recommend? IMO, studying abroad should not be about prestige. It should be about widening your perspective on other cultures, etc. UCLA, Berkley, and UCSB all have pretty different surrounding environments. UCLA is in LA, which is obviously a huge city (albeit car-centric). Berkeley is near a pretty big city, but the area surrounding it is much less metropolitan. The vibe there is definitely not for everyone. UCSB is pretty isolated, but its literally on the beach You're from the UK, how could Berkeley be too cold for you? If you want a nice climate and a fun atmosphere, go to UCSB and don't care about prestige. Hi Im a UK Exchange student studying at UCLA :) I was originally going to choose Berkeley cause it‚Äôs most prestigious back home but I heard there‚Äôs a huge housing crisis and they won‚Äôt prioritize exchange students and a major crime problem. Another exchange student I know lived in a hotel for a month before he could find housing.  UCLA as an exchange student coming in sept you will be placed in either off campus apartments or on campus in the transfer LLC so it‚Äôs important to put the LLC as your top housing choice if you want to get placed on campus.  I like UCLA, greek life is not a huge thing here at all it‚Äôs a lot less of a drinking culture than the UK tbh. Theres tons of clubs (even ones for consulting) and the UBS business club is great for consulting opportunities and training.  I would choose UCLA again if I had to go back in time but I recommend putting berkeley in your top 3 the reason being UCLA and Berkeley are really competitive (50% of all UCEAP applicants put them as their first choice) so if you do what I did and go UCLA, some other UC, Berkeley then they will have a 50% chance of putting you in UCLA instead of 33% chance because putting Berkeley third is a write off.  If prestige matters most - Berkeley (by UK standards it‚Äôs miles above) If having a good experience matters most - UCLA/UCSB  Which UK uni are you coming from? Feel free to DM me with any questions about UCLA from a UK perspective I mean there's sororities but if you're not interested, they're easily avoidable? You'll be fine with the weather in Berkeley. Most UCLA students are fine without a car. Sure it's nice to have but you can still get around without it. Berkeley will be about the same car wise, it's just a little easier to get to BART then it is for UCLA to get to the Metro (even tho I don't consider that hard either).  What do YOU want? You mentioned consulting, where is better for that? What do you want from a social aspect? How do you envision yourself making the most out of your trip? Would you rather explore LA or the Bay? UCSB parties like it's American Pie lol   UCLA is in GTA UCLA is the way to go Berkeley isn't that cold :) Colder than LA for sure but not enough for it to be a problem, especially if you're from the UK. I love the weather in Berkeley, spare a couple of weeks in the winter. + I never went to a single greek life event at UCLA and had an active social life.  I would go to the school where the campus culture and weather make you the most excited. Look and see if there are active clubs for your hobby or sport. They're all academically good schools, and for just one year you won't be too impacted by rigor or the prestige on your resume. If you want to experience the stereotypical American college experience, UCSB is your spot. For studying abroad, prestige doesn't matter. If you're planning to try to use this for networking in consulting, UCB and UCLA have huge consulting pipelines. UCLA is in LA, the nearest consulting firm (LEK) is walking distance from campus, McKinsey is 15m away in Century City, and all the others are downtown about 30m away by train. They hold tons of events on campus in the fall. Berkley is probably similar, but you'll get that same exposure here. [deleted] I would do UCLA or Berkeley. Santa Barbara is nice, but just too small to get the most out of your experience overseas. More worth as a small one or two day trip.  Also, I wouldn't not choose UCLA due to car centrism. If you're comfortable with public transit, it's not as car dependent as you'd think. People are under the impression that public transit doesn't exist. And there are a good amount of people in LA who will back it up because they don't use the public transit themselves. In fact, I knew a British guy who came to UCLA for a postdoc, and when asked what his biggest surprise about LA was his answer was that the public transit was not nearly as bad as what he was expecting, and that the bus system was surprisingly good (especially for daily commuting *within* the Westside via BigBlueBus). He had assumed he would eventually have to give in and get a car, but never felt the need to in his few years at UCLA. I‚Äôm from San Diego, UCSB is the only one where you actually get a feel for California culture. UCLA and UCB are like their own little worlds deep in a sea of concrete. UCLA!!!! Without a doubt! Definitely not UCSB. I visited there and the beach is actually really cold. I go to UCLA now and there‚Äôs actually a solid transportation system via bus AND you can rent zip cars. I don‚Äôt know anything about UCB though. As someone who did their undergrad at UCSB and is doing grad school at UCLA, I would 100% suggest attending UCSB. Although, the UCLA campus has prettier buildings and is more prestigious UCSB is absolutely gorgeous. You have the ocean at most a 10-minute walk and then mountains a 30-minute drive away. There's an adventure program at UCSB where you pay 60$ and can rent any outdoor gear for free after that, which even if you don't have a car allows you to do so much around the campus. I wouldn‚Äôt go to Berkeley if you have to find your own housing/ deal with housing. Currently ucb is having a ton of housing issues My recommendation would be UCLA. There is an argument for Berkeley from a reputational perspective, but I would caution you on the crime. I am American and do not always feel safe in Berkeley/SF. Coming from abroad, I think it could potentially make you a target. Odds are you will be fine, but if I were sending someone I care about from abroad to study at one of the UCs, it would not be Berkeley for this reason. UCLA's campus is very safe, beautiful, and the school has a strong and improving reputation. Santa Barbara is a great area, but I think you'd be sacrificing too much in terms of rigor and reputation if you selected UCSB over UCLA.  My friend‚Äôs from the UK also doing abroad. He chose UCLA. I would too. My other friend‚Äôs from ucb and it‚Äôs just not worth it. Academically and fun wise, UCLA all the way. Ucb is sooo dangerous gunshots everyday etc. Been on a call with my friend many times and 4 of these calls were gunshots from the bottom floor as the homeless people cause riots. Also the city not bring safe after 6pm? That‚Äôs crazy. It‚Äôs a university town. The university is safe, Berkeley as a city is not. >ucla seems problematic regarding not having a car regarding travel to nearby areas  Yes but compared to the other two UCs this is only a problem because UCLA has nearby places to travel in the first place. The other two don‚Äôt. Berkeley the town quite frankly is a shithole (I suppose a bit more of a college town vibe but still pretty bad) and SB is on the other end of the scale, suburban and boring. And we do have transit here at ucla, even if it‚Äôs not the best.  I wouldn‚Äôt worry about prestige either though, it‚Äôs a study abroad thing it‚Äôs not gonna be on your degree. To UC SANTA CRUZ lol  Jk I would go to Berkeley not LA Santa Barbara is ok too I will say (coming from someone who was admitted to Berkeley but declined to attend in the end), the quality of life will be higher in LA than in berkeley (safer, nicer surrounding area) Yes, it is cold up there and if you‚Äôre not really for that, it can affect your experience there more than you would think (that was a factor in my decision too).   Yes, in UCLA, having a car go go somewhere is almost a must, but as a student you spend really most of your time on campus and only occasionally go out. Go bears (I‚Äôm biased) but the competitive atmosphere at Berkeley is not how it is cracked up to be. I‚Äôve actually found many students willing to help others in a variety of classes (including STEM classes where ppl tend to believe there‚Äôs more toxicity). it‚Äôs what you make it out to be! UCLA or UCSB üôèüèºüôèüèº As someone who did undergrad at Cal & currently at ucla for grad school, Berkeley for sure. You can go to clubs/bars/get food all within a few short blocks from each other. And hikes/outdoorsy stuff if ur into that. Public transport; take the train & get to sf in 30 minutes too. Ucla is a beautiful campus/place to be, but I could not imagine having fun here and exploring without a car. It‚Äôs definitely a car city 100%. And, doesn‚Äôt have as much of a downtown/city/young people vibe. Westwood is a lot of rich older ppl, while Berkeley is like all students. Would not go UCB, there are so many muggings up there. Berkeley and SF is crime central, and since you‚Äôre walking around you‚Äôll be a target.   LA is definitely better in that regard, you‚Äôll have to uber a lot and put up with shitty public transport but it is doable. Also sorority culture? Don‚Äôt know where you heard that from.  SB is extremely nice, but not much around compared to LA/B. As long as you live near the campus you don‚Äôt need a car, I ubered all along wherever I go, and like many students here you don‚Äôt have to join a frat/soro. UCB‚Äôs campus is much more dangerous. I have friends their who were chased by a homeless in front of their dorms and last year there was a active shooter on campus and they shut down the whole campus for a day to catch that guy. UCSB‚Äôs a great place, they have a beach inside their campus but honestly their party culture is much bigger than you think (if you don‚Äôt like it), and there‚Äôs not much to do in SB, you can literally travel all over SB in a day. So welcome to UCLA :) if i were in your position, i would honestly go for ucsb-- there is no better school to get a taste of what the ideal life (at least in my opinion) in california is like. if you look up pictures of the campus, you'll see it's literally on the beach... like, right there. many of my friends going to that school have ocean views from where they live, and they go to the beach pretty much every single day.   i would not focus on prestige for study abroad. i'm studying abroad over the summer & chose my campus & location solely based on what area i wanted to experience. the home institution played no factor in my decision.   however, to each their own! it's really up to you and what you're looking to get out of your study abroad experience. you really can't go wrong. ucla is a great school, but i'm personally not a fan of its location. i don't really like the city, but some people do! if you like the city, then somewhere like ucla or ucb is going to be a better choice than ucsb. All are great options. UCSB has a LOT of prestige so don‚Äôt worry about that. If you want to go somewhere beautiful with great beach vibes, UCSB would be great. UCLA has a beautiful campus with a very collegiate vibe and such a vibrant, academic atmosphere. Berkeley can get a bit gloomy with the weather at time, but the town has lots of fun things to do, especially if you‚Äôre artsy-indie vibes. All are fantastic schools so don‚Äôt worry about prestige too much when choosing. I did my undergrad at Cal and am now at UCLA for graduate school.    I don't know you, but I would recommend Berkeley, for myself.    Getting a good grade in major prereq classes is competitive at every large school, and all three of the schools you mentioned are large.  If you sit near the front and talk to people, it's easy to find or make a motivated study group.  At Cal, I would characterize my experience as primarily collaborative, as opposed to competitive.  LA's weather is fine, and Cal's more often justifies a sweater and a hot cup of tea or coffee.  Either is fine by me.     I like getting outdoors.  On the weekend here in LA, I go home and maybe try to meal prep or bake something.  In Berkeley, you could do that - and then walk from your apartment up the trail behind Clark Kerr to watch the fog roll in under the sunset.  I had a significantly higher QoL there.  You can find hikes in LA, but...probably not on weekdays due to traffic, and it'll take at least a half hour to an hour to get to the nearest decent path.    Also, Berkeley Bowl is *awesome.*  I enjoy cooking, and wish there was a similar market in LA.  Might seem strange to talk about a supermarket when choosing a school, but it was a spot I visited once a week or more, which makes it one of the places I visited most often in college.  The markets here suck by comparison.  You could visit the Korean Galleria Market, a 99 Ranch, and Elat & Glatt, and you still wouldn't have the variety of Berkeley Bowl.    But you're not me.  You mentioned getting to \"nearby areas.\"  What for?  What do you like doing? Ucsb hands down LA is warm and nice, plus you can walk to a lot of places around UCLA. So you don‚Äôt really need a car. If anything, just use the scooters that are all over campus.   But if UCB is better suited for your career choice then might as well head over there. UCSB. I lived in SB at as college student for 3 years before transferring to UCLA. Living in Isla Vista is one of the most magical things that you can do in life. Hands down UCSB for your exchange UCSB for certain Just do ucla and take a trip to sb and Berkeley along the pacific coast highway is the only proper move If you're a big sports fan like I am, UCLA might be the way to go. It's fun attending live games where the team you're rooting for is mostly competent in whatever they're playing. Something else to consider is that I feel UCLA is quite strong in the arts and humanities as well as STEM, and has lots of student clubs to support those interests. Can't say for the other schools. If you don't go to UCLA you won't be able to see me (though I am going to a conference at Berkeley this summer) Berkeley and SB are having housing crises and housing in general at those schools aren‚Äôt the best. Not having a car at UCLA isn‚Äôt too bad because a lot of things are walking distance, you can scooter, or if you want to explore you can easily use the bus and get around the city especially if you‚Äôve never experienced Los Angeles. Berkeley and LA definitely have the nicer (in my opinion) campuses, and sorority culture really isn‚Äôt prevalent at UCLA unless you seek it out yourself. Just finished at Berkeley, hit me up! Also, neither a dirty nor unsafe town, it was insanely fun and beautiful. And I live in LA now - thank god I have a car and it was freezing today! UCSB if you like to party If you‚Äôre looking for a once in a lifetime experience while attending a good school, I‚Äôd go to UCSB. Top 5 patty school in the country, located in the beach, one of the best cities in the country (Santa Barbara). Lots of international students as well so you‚Äôll meet all walks of life. UCSB is worth considering for sure but I'd probably do UCLA.   All the reasons why are listed in the UCLA song :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2EM5o8stKo Ucsb, santa barbara is infinitely better area then la. La is full of trash and homeless and is discusting. Santa barbara is beautiful and much cleaner area. Berkley area is kind of destroyed by the rain and people are kind of full of them selves. Ucla is a fantastic school but its in la which is garbage. Everything is expensive and the area is disgusting and honestly the city really doesnt hve anything going for it. Do ucsb If being able to get around outside of the campus without a car is important to you, then choose Berkeley. The public transport is much better there. Looking at google maps, it seems like you can go from UCB to San Francisco in about 40 minutes using the public transportation. If you do choose UCLA though and want cheap social housing/food I highly recommend the ucha housing coop [https://www.uchaonline.com/](https://www.uchaonline.com/) . Having studied at Berkeley and UCLA both, I would choose UCLA for a great overall experience of academics and social life ucla!!! ucla!!! as someone who goes to ucla and doesn‚Äôt have a car it‚Äôs not necessary. public transport can take you most places you want to go or you make friends with people who have cars. additionally westwood is extremely walkable which is really nice. even as someone in a sorority i don‚Äôt really feel like greek life is a huge part of the ucla campus culture. like most ppl aren‚Äôt involved in sorority/fraternity life and there really no judgment for not being involved or not being a party person. It kinda depends on what you want. Most schools do have a ‚Äòzip‚Äô car or equivalent so you could always take a driving test and rent those to drive. You‚Äôll be here long enough so it would be practical.   UCSB= walk from your dorm to the beach and cute artsy downtown  UCB= maybe stay on campus(school isn‚Äôt in the best area) or go to SF  UCLA= beach and proximity to downtown LA    (My opinion as a Southern California native)  LA is highly overrated and you can find similar entertainment options elsewhere. I‚Äôve visited SF and had a great time, and I frequently go to SB for the day or for morning coffee/lunch. I‚Äôd pick one of those over LA anytime.   You could most likely find friends who want to visit LA on the weekends if you went to UCSB. And vice versa if you went to UCLA. With UCB it would be SF only.    (Other considerations) All three areas of the schools you listed have homeless populations, so keep that in mind. Not all homeless people are mean or cause issues. I‚Äôd say because UCSB is such a secluded rich area they are not typically an issue there.   In terms of the ‚Äòprestige‚Äô UCSB is currently #32 in the US, UCLA and UCB are tied at #20. Really most of the UCs come with prestige though.    Ultimately picked the school where you think you‚Äôd have more fun! You‚Äôre not getting a degree there so overall your main school will matter more. Last thing you want to do is go to a school you hate and have a terrible year. You probably have more than enough opinions at this point, but I see many of them conflict. I recommend thinking about what YOU want to get out of the exchange experience. Prioritize a list.   1. Academic prestige? 2. Campus culture? 3. California vibe? 4. Sight-seeing off campus?  At the completion of your exchange program what will you consider a good experience?   I‚Äôm a California native. I graduated from UCLA and have visited UCB and UCSB many times in my life. They are all very different. For academic prestige, you can find the data.  That‚Äôs simple. But what else matters to YOU?   Santa Barbara is the most scenic and beautiful. Many Californians would live there if they could afford it, but there are not a lot of career jobs there. The campus culture is more relaxed than UCB and UCLA. This can be really nice. The downtown areas and beaches are lovely. Santa Barbara is a weekend vacation destination for many Californians looking to get out of their city for a small retreat. You could have a picturesque experience at UCSB, close to nature for hikes and ocean views.   However, UCSB definitely has a student housing shortage (as does UCB).  There isn‚Äôt enough housing inventory. You should do some research on the percentage of students who are homeless (living in cars). UCLA is far ahead of UCSB and UCB when it comes to available student housing. To reduce the headache of housing, UCLA would be the #1 choice. UCLA currently guarantees student housing for four years for incoming Freshman and for two years for Transfers. I don‚Äôt know the housing policy for Exchange students but I can tell you that neither UCB nor UCSB can guarantee student housing the way UCLA can right now. Both schools are trying to build more housing but it has been slow progress.   Another consideration is whether you want to sight see more of California? Did you want to see more than just your school campus while you are here?  Sightseeing from Santa Barbara will NOT be easy. Santa Barbara is geographically isolated from other cities. Look up a map. UCB is close to San Francisco and Oakland. You can easily take weekend trips to explore Angel Island, the Golden Gate Bridge, Chinatown, Alcatraz, etc. From Berkeley, you can explore local sights nearby and feel like you got to know more of California than just your school campus.   The same is true of UCLA. You will be close to Santa Monica Pier, West Hollywood, museums, Griffith Observatory, local concerts and sporting activities. Some places you can get to using public transportation. Some places you‚Äôll need to take an Uber. But no matter what, there are still tons more to explore in Los Angeles than in Santa Barbara. You just need to ask yourself what kind of traveler are you? What kind of California experience do you want?  Would you prefer to spend your time in a beach town vacation destination like Santa Barbara or in a city with lots of activity like Berkeley or Los Angeles? It‚Äôs a personal preference, really. You can‚Äôt make a wrong decision. I‚Äôm confident you could enjoy any of these choices.   My daughter is a current senior at UCLA. One of her roommates found a group on campus who organized a weekend trip to go camping in Joshua Tree for just $75, including transportation from UCLA and food. Her roommate is from Indonesia and wanted to see more of California while attending UCLA and sought out this type of desert adventure. She loved it.   Good luck to you! As a UCLA Alum, I am biased and recommend UCLA. I think the diversity of student demographics, clubs, activities, social events, student resources and services offered at UCLA is unmatched. But you need to find the right fit for YOU. :) Fr? You‚Äôre delusional lol You have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about. Santa Barbara is one of the most gorgeous parts of the state. And UCSB is not far from downtown at all. I would 100% choose ucsb or ucla as a second LMAO. It‚Äôs like 7-10 mins to downtown and there is zero traffic. You can fucking bike from UCSB to downtown SB faster than you can get from UCLA to Santa Monica by car.  Enjoy your campus bubble in the middle of a concrete wasteland shithole. I‚Äôll be hiking while you sit on the 405 ü§£. I also take public transportation around LA but I do think it is pretty bad outside a few key areas. If you are just going around westwood with the big blue bus, it is pretty good, but going to different areas in LA takes a long time and many connections. All pacific water is cold by North America Ummm what? I live in Berkeley and it‚Äôs not ‚Äúdangerous.‚Äù If you don‚Äôt leave your laptop unattended it‚Äôs fine. Yes there are a lot of homeless people (also in Westwood and maybe also Isla Vista, I‚Äôm not sure). But homeless people are not shooting anyone. The GTA comment? Yeah it‚Äôs in West LA. They shrunk the campus in the game like a lot to the city, but it‚Äôs there. It takes 12 minutes to get from Westwood, where UCLA is, to West Hollywood. UCLA to Santa Monica is 15-20 minutes. Did you not get accepted by UCLA or something? So aggressive that's salty even for the beach As someone who took public trans for my daily commute during my time at UCLA, I agree. But I'd put it this way: most of transit time is your daily commute, so if you can live next to a convenient bus line that goes direct to UCLA, you're set for 90% of your transit trips. And BBB uses UCLA as a transit hub, so if you can manage living on the Westside,  chances are you can find a nearby bus that goes straight to UCLA with frequent headways.  Beyond daily commute, yeah, it's patchy. But I found that taking ubers on the weekends is still waaaaay cheaper than owning a car for something you mostly only need on those weekends.   But I feel a lot of people who don't take public transit don't understand this point. They say, yeah, there's a bus to school/work, but how will I get to hypothetical X, Y, or Z on the weekends? Without asking themselves how often they go to X, Y, and Z and if it's worth the cost of owning a car vs ubering for those occasional outings. I meant the weather actually. It‚Äôs windy and chilly. No it‚Äôs just downright laughable to say UCSB is ‚Äúfar from the actual town‚Äù when it‚Äôs right on the beach, overlooking the mountains, and 10-15 minutes of easy car/bus ride to get ‚Äúto the actual town‚Äù (any time, any day). UCLA to Santa Monica can easily be 40 minutes if traffic is bad. UCLA is a trap surrounded by a shit hole city a urban planner would have nightmares about, you know it, you just don‚Äôt want to admit it.   ‚ÄúNot that pretty actually‚Äù?  Yeah so beautiful looking through dense smog at RPV is basically living in the Alps üôÑ.  Academic smack is weak. ‚ÄúPrestige‚Äù is fucking dumb . I‚Äôm a post-doc that went MIT->Stanford->UCSB (check my post history if you really care). I‚Äôve met brilliant people at all three and dumbasses at all three. One of the smartest engineers I know went to UND for undergrad. I‚Äôd hire him over me and all my credentials. [deleted] UCSB isn‚Äôt even in Santa Barbara, it‚Äôs in Goleta. And it takes almost an hour to get from campus to downtown SB by bike. https://www.nbclosangeles.com/local-2/report-says-la-has-most-polluted-air-in-united-states/2853463/?amp=1 Again, what exactly is the point here? It‚Äôs in the SB census statistical area. Is being in Goleta supposed to be a knock against the school? You still have the same beach front setting along the bluffs with mountain views‚Ä¶.you‚Äôre just 7 miles down the coast. No it‚Äôs not an hour bike, it‚Äôs 30-45. Also there is a bus (24x) that takes 20 mins.  UCLA is in Westwood. Accessing other neighborhoods in LA is MUCH more difficult than a UCSB student accessing downtown SB. Touting the benefit of UCLA accessing the urban culture of LA (or beach life, or outdoor life) is MORE disingenuous. Have fun biking to Santa Monica, sounds relaxing üòÇ. Or your hour long bus ride ü§£. [deleted] Oh you can see RPV every day? That‚Äôs cool. You must have special bionic eyes.  Get semantic all you want, a polluted shit hole is a polluted shit hole.

[CLOSED] DMed housing app question! Im a rising 2nd year who lived on the hill this year, and my friend who is also a rising 2nd year are trying to dorm together next year. because she was a commuter student, she got put in the lottery system? but because ive alr lived on the hill i have rsu. is there anyway for us to room together? or for us to request eachother? I get they dont want freshman to request upperclassmen but shes not a freshman so is there anyway to get around it? i was in this position last year as the dorm friend, and there's pretty much no way around it :( your commuter friend can try asking housing to accommodate her request, but unless there's a really really really good reason they probably won't honor it. my friend ended up in an apartment because of it. it's still worth a shot to ask though, good luck! ugh thats so annoying, nvm then i guess üò≠ thank you tho! anyone who submitted a housing app but aren't accepting it Hi  My friend and I want to live in a university apartment next year.  I am in the RSU system And he's in the Lottery system  Which means we can't form a group of RSU and lottery system people  The only way to guarantee we get in the same apartment is if there's an extra spot in the apartment.  So if there's anyone who submitted a housing app, but already have different housing plans and wants to help me out. Please join my roommate group and leave once I secured the room selection so my friend can join, I would appreciate it greatly Parking Is it possible to keep my car in one of the structures for just a week and buy a permit every day?

Will pay I have an internship that starts on June 5th 2023 (nope I can‚Äôt be flexible on the start date) and am looking for ECON/MGMT classes that I can complete without taking an in person final exam ‚Äî I‚Äôve been wanting to take Econ 165 for a while and know that there‚Äôs only a final presentation (which I can complete online).

Is anyone willing to add me to their roommate group or form one with me? I'm not doing gender inclusive housing btw  Thanks in advance! What year are you? I‚Äôm in the same situation as you! I‚Äôd love to group with you, what are your living preferences? I‚Äôm going into my second year. Need early RSU time (willing to pay) please Does anyone have an early roommate signup time (3/6) for next year? We are a group of four friends (gender inclusive) looking to live together and would greatly appreciate it if someone with an early signup time has space to add us to their roommate group.  We're hoping to get a 4 (person) / 2 (bed) or a 4/4. Please reach out to me! Willing to pay. Oof rsu times were rough this year, sorry but I can't help. i think all of us got bad enrollment times tbh but good luck Sounds like you guys have it rough :( Good luck with searching! How can I check my enrollment time? ^ RSU sign up group Hi I'm interested in joining people to form a group for RSU! I am going to be a second year (this is obv my first time doing this) and am interested in getting an apartment, preferably near Gayley or Landfair! I go to bed between 11-12 and wake up at around 8-9. I tend to be introverted. I like cooking, baking, and making creative things. I love listening to music as well, any twenty one pilots fans? If you are similar to me in any way, feel free to DM! Idk how to dm on here bc I‚Äôm literally 68 years old üò≠ but I‚Äôm interestedddd Willing to pay- can anyone hold a spot for me in Psych 120A?  Dr. Robin Kay psychologist job? Has anyone worked for Dr. Robin Kay‚Äôs psychology clinic (Hilgard)? I see her job posts often on the Psychology Undergrad listserv, and am wondering if anyone has experience working with her and how it was. I applied for a job there and was supposed to get interviewed and they literally ghosted me lmao. Their office seems super disorganized ngl I got weird vibes my roommate worked there & didn't like it.. they didn't seem to care about my roommate's outside commitments & expected them to dedicate an unreasonable amount of time. when my roommate asked about scheduling one week after working there for months they completely ghosted them lol I also applied and was ghosted after being interviewed once.  Don't do it.  She seemed sus af ngl How is Math 156/164? I am considering a math minor with the end goal of these courses, and I want to see if it is worth it. I am a CS major, and I wanted to have more of a mathematical background in machine learning and probability. Took Math 164 with Sonthalia and it was impossible not to get an A in that class. Was also a pretty interesting class, but if you want to learn more about the subject EE 133A is a better class to take. Keep in mind as a CS major you have to take things like 115A and 131A to meet the prereqs for these classes! I'm aware. I'm trying to decide if it's worth going 115A->131A->170A->164->156 I‚Äôm currently finishing a math minor (for the love of the subject) and my path was 115A -> 106 -> 115B -> 131A -> 135. 131 is pretty brutal, but super interesting (you basically invent numbers from scratch), I love linear algebra, so 115A/B was fun, but these schedules are brutal and horrible. Lectures usually seem rushed because the quarter system forces them to teach the subject in such a short time. So just be aware of all that. I also think it shores up your formal logic which should help in engineering. minor/major overlap Can I apply stuff from sci-tech and tech-breadth and also GEs to a minor? In engineering No Looking for a 2bd 4ppl RSU in a building with parking (female and non-smoking only) DM me if your interested! Global Internship in Osaka hii if anyone else was accpeted into or is doing this program for this summer reply or pm me and we can make a gc and get to know each other! Best classes you've taken at UCLA? I'm a graduating senior social science major and have some space to fill this spring, feeling emo choosing these last classes. Was there a class that changed your life? Has stuck with you for a long time? Helped you learn a new/applicable skill? Had a sick prof? Preferably not a heinous amount of work lol. Hoping to try something new! Really enjoying Classics 140. Zenios is really nice, plus he does a great job directly engaging with individual students in a non-stressful way. Lots of reading but not too much other work. It‚Äôs a super fun class imo I really enjoyed EPS Sci 15. Pretty cool if you like learning about the earth and the ocean. evolutionary medicine with dr. molly fox (I believe it is anthro 129). She is one of the most knowledgeable, passionate, and kind professors I have ever met. I was learning something brand new every lecture, it was simply a remarkable and eye opening class that I was exctied to attend to for the joy of learning Psych 137C Intimate Relationships with Bradbury or Kearny or any Developmental Psych class with Goff!! They‚Äôre pretty easy and they‚Äôre some of the most amazing professors Art History 25 PS 119 with Branstetter if you manage to snag a spot, bro's really chill and passionate about political theory Wow none of them are engineering here lolz Anything taught by Nile Green or Dave Daversa I graduated back in 2019, but the best class I ever took here was FTV 122N (history of animation) with Charles Solomon. Super interesting class, and the professor is incredibly passionate about the material. Highly recommend if it‚Äôs still offered!!!! Chicano class for day of dead (only in fall tho, think its 116 or 114.)  English M30   Film TV 144  Soc Gen 5  EEB 186 I highly recommend Art and Architecture 10!! Super fun and engaging Anything with Dr. Mary Corey, she‚Äôs one of my two favorite professors. I took three of her classes. POLI SCI 111C with Panagia - most fascinating philosophy/ modern political theory I loved ls 15 and ftv 6A Take Art 10: Art Encounters. They bring a new artist every week to talk to the class and there's usually a performance or visit to see the artist's work every week. It's a bit of time commitment but the work is very simple. EEB 186 Anthro 194S. Blew my mind. ANTHRO 149- Feminist Anthro, HONORS COLL 159- Feminism, Art & Metaphors of Trauma, ARTHIS 25- Museum Studies, HIST M133C- History of Prostitution. I really liked ART HIS 30 with Kersey. Really fun, interesting, and easy class about Japanese art. Geog 4 with sheppard Econ 101 w Haanwinckel Was literally about to say this he‚Äôs great I second this! The labs are really interesting and Treude gives solid and interesting lectures. The work wasn‚Äôt that bad either. taking this now and i love it!! Impossible to get if you‚Äôre not a poli sci major Branstetter is the fucking GOAT Practically minored in branstetter RT love that man none of our classes fit ‚Äúnot a heinous amt of work‚Äù ü´†  or we‚Äôd recommend something like m51a that I really enjoyed and 99% of others wouldn‚Äôt agree ü•≤ Recommend CS 35L with Eggert üíÄ Second the Chicano Day of Dead class. I believe it‚Äôs actually Chicano 113. Took it my senior year and it was the chillest class. After the group altar presentation at SPARC, you don‚Äôt do much except for another group presentation that focuses on how you would like to pass on the Day of the Dead tradition. I loved 140C taught by her. Very cool to learn about the civil rights movement from someone who was alive and active in it. Panagia is one hell of a lecturer. no bitches?? I really enjoyed EC ENGR 214A lol I love digital design! Engr would be sick! Prob wouldn‚Äôt get in first pass but I‚Äôve heard really good things ab engr 96 classes sorry that‚Äôs too far I couldn‚Äôt agree more! see we sound like psychos ü§° 96C is cool but I didn‚Äôt learn too much ‚Äî I think you get what you put in I agree with you.. ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ Looking for a Single Pod RSU group (m) Hi! I‚Äôm a rising Junior looking to start or join a single pod group for next year, preferably in Rieber Terrace for Early RSU. Let me know if you want to group up! I also have a TV I‚Äôd probably put in the lounge if that means anything! message me! i‚Äôm looking for a group I want to create a petition for UCLA to have food trucks at the apartments. How do I go about doing this? I live in the university apartments and I know that many people are upset that they cannot get the meal plan. I get it- cooking and grocery shopping are time consuming and many of us have small kitchens and dishwashers and with limited pantry and fridge space. Since the school cannot give us meal plans because they are understaffed, I believe they should have food trucks for students in the university apartments.   I don‚Äôt know exactly where they would go. I‚Äôm still figuring that out. But I went to an RSU meeting that housing had and someone suggested that they offer food trucks by the university apartments for students living in these complexes. The two housing officials hosting the meeting said that‚Äôs a good idea and they would look into it. I plan on calling housing on Tuesday or Thursday to make my case.   I think it would help to start a petition for this- I think many people would be in support of it. How would I go about doing this? UCLA apartments are kinda spread out ... so you would have to put the trucks in a central area... but that area is already packed with restaurants...  I don't think it works out. damn mixed use neighborhoods could fix this Ayo yes please the chameclas mariscos truck be dope on campus I would sign that petition in a heartbeat There is space by Southwest campus, gayley heights, glenrock, landfair, etc. There is room for several food trucks. This is true but it‚Äôs not a realistic or timely solution for us. The best we can do is encourage housing to provide us with food trucks just as they do for on-campus students. thoughts on gayley court any one who lives in gayley court in a 2bed/2bath can you tell me how it is pls? thanks hard wood floors which dorms have hardwood floors? just courtside? Dykstra as well Which of these upper division econ classes would you recommend? Econ 123  (Forecasting Exchange Rates and Constructing Currency Portfolios) w/ Tornell   Econ 165 ( History of Capitalism in American Economy ) w/ Surro     Econ 160 (Money and Banking) w/Convery  MGMT 170 ( Real Estate Finance and Investments) w/  Karlan, M.S. Econ 123 is pretty chill (no midterm, hw graded on completion) and you learn a lot about investing in currencies and how things affect exchange rates. 165 I heard was super easy and it‚Äôs slightly more qualitative than normal Econ classes but there‚Äôs a presentation at the end so I‚Äôm probably not gonna take it and it usually fills up even before senior first pass. Mgmt 170 I heard was easy but it‚Äôs a lot of calculations and heard Econ 160 was chill Surro the üêê and 165 was a fun class. Also 160 is a super interesting topic if you enjoy monetary policy. Real estate finance ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® Not nesicarly because of the content - youtube is much better for that. But it's really for the types of people you get to meet in there. A lot of hustlers and people in differing asset types would bring interesting conversations and perspectives, and potential partners. appreciate the info üôè Which is better, a 4 bd/4 person single or a 2 bd/3 person single? Does anyone have any experiences they can share? I want a single bedroom in an apartment but I‚Äôm not quite sure what difference would be between the two. 2bd/3person you deal with less people more you can check but pretty sure there are less 2 bed/3 singles tho so chances of getting one are prob pretty low unless you have a priority RSU time What‚Äôs considered priority time? some of yall's parents cannot drive!! like they are danger to all the people living on the hill and beyond lmao Last year i was walking from de neve to sproul like that little intersection, and some lady straight up decided to start driving when i was in the middle of the crosswalk. I jumped so far but she still kinda got me in the back and then stopped astonished. like ??????? shoulda sued How do I know which management classes satisify the econ degree? Currently taking one that doesn't so I don't want to run into that again lol https://economics.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-Econ-Major-Requirements-Worksheet-2021-2022.pdf  It‚Äôs on the bottom of the second page. I think it‚Äôs just any upper div accounting class or Mgmt 170. For biz Econ, any mgmt class counts though   https://economics.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4.-Bus-Econ-Major-Requirement-Worksheet-Updated-August-2022.pdf you can look through the classes that count for each requirement on your Degree Progress Report/DARS on myucla thanks! Looking for 4/4 RSU group Looking to join a group that wants a 4/4 in the uni apts.   Male, current junior (transfer student). I currently live in a 4/8 and it‚Äôs really nice, so a 4/4 would be even better. I‚Äôm really quiet, don‚Äôt smoke, and fun social apartmentmates would be a plus but don‚Äôt mind less social people either.   My RSU time is 3/6 12pm so idk if that matters. What's your major? Me too Should I take Chem 14A next quarter or wait till fall quarter to take 14AE? I know that the 14 series is quite long so I want to start as soon as possible. However, I have 0 background in chem and I cannot risk getting a bad grade. I heard you get extra help in 14AE so I was thinking it would be better to wait until fall quarter. But if the difference between the two is not big I would rather just take 14A next quarter since I don‚Äôt plan on enrolling in more than 15 units anyway. I took chem14A with no background and it was a little hard but there are many resources to help you! Plus you could try it out and if you think youd want the extra help then you could always drop before week 4 An option would be to take Chem 17 prior to taking the 14 series so that you can learn the basics. What kind of resources? I was considering that, but I am premed and from what I‚Äôve heard 14A is also supposed to be an introductory course. I'm in AAP so I had access to the peer learning sessions which honestly saved my grade. Also Lavelle has been teaching chem for years so chem community has a ton of answered questions if ur ever confused! PSA: Ready Refresh Water Scam There were some people who were knocking door-to-door saying that they are from ready-refresh and due to upcoming water shortages, UCLA would be providing free water. They gave a QR code and asked me to fill it out to purchase some water and a dispenser. However, there was a deposit. They said that this is just a deposit that will be refunded after the water arrives, but I think it was a scam.  A few minutes later, my RA and someone from sproul front desk post in the groupme that this group is a scam and that UCPD is dispatched on them.   Don't give them any info, stay safe y'all.

Based on my SHIP at Berkeley I would expect $400 minimum I hope it‚Äôs covered, or at least most of it. Ambulances are like $5000 Philos 31: Logic !!!! Please oh my god does anyone know how to use Logic 2010 and do derivations. I will literally fail the midterm can someone help pleaseeeeeeeee. i remember doing that lol when I took the class, there were a ton of tutors that held office hours on a schedule the professor posted, plus there was the TA and the professor with their own office hours. are there no longer tutors?  I could probably help out on a few questions if you want though, I still have logic 2010 installed I can help Car vs bird Some guy yelled ‚Äúsidewalk‚Äù at me when I was on a bird in the left turn yield lane to turn left into a neighborhood.   Whether he was a ucla student or not, birds r like bikes you can‚Äôt use the sidewalk bc of pedestrians like bffr   Anyway I def disagree w how people ride their scooters on bruinwalk bc there are way too many pedestrians to do it safely BUT   I followed traffic laws and rode the bird accordingly. Just cuz Im not going 45 mph in a 20 doesn‚Äôt mean u get to yell at me. Dicks fr In CA, you have to do a Box Turn if you want to turn left on a Bird.  https://www.bird.co/blog/take-the-lane-safety-essentials-every-e-scooter-rider-needs-to-know/ i have my own scooter that i use to go to my classes. I almost got hit by a fucking prius because i was obeying traffic laws. ü´† people cant drive for shit As a commuter cyclist you‚Äôll find out that drivers feel entitled to the entire road. The best advice I can give you is make your self seen, as when appropriate (multiple direction lane road) don‚Äôt stick to riding the shoulder because they will either act like they can not see you, or they actually won‚Äôt see you and will hurt you. Ride in the lane in manner where it forces cars to go around you (like in the middle), it might be a ‚Äúdick‚Äù move according to drives, but you‚Äôll be a ‚Äúdick‚Äù that gets to your destination alive and in one piece. Good luck, and at least slow down, look both ways before blasting through a light, if it‚Äôs something you feel you must do. if there's a list of rules for scooters that most people are unaware of, i would really appreciate someone sharing it You‚Äôre telling me i cant just sit in the left turn lane? I didn‚Äôt know this, thanks for sharing. Can I do a box turn on a 3 way junction? That‚Äôs where I was Bruh people r so impatient!! I‚Äôm sorry this happened As a Prius owner, I apologize.

I am a rising junior looking for roommates interested in forming a group in the deluxe rooms at Sproul landing or Sproul cove.  I am an Asian male, and here are some of the things that are important to me:  I sleep and get up early on the weekdays (sleep around 10:30 and get up around 6:30)  I do not drink, smoke, nor will I host parties in the room.  I will clean up my space regularly. I prefer the room to be colder when we sleep, and I am completely cool with music or TV on when we're studying.   One thing you should know is that I have a full-size piano/keyboard, but you are welcome to play at any time!  If you think we would be compatible roommates, send me a message, and I can answer any questions you may have! how likely to get sproul cove/landing for march 7 early rsu date Not the last rsu date but also not the earliest :/ anyone remember previous year trends??

Transferring to UCLA School of Nursing Hello, I am an 18 yr female attending a school at another UC. I didn't realize that I wanted to become a nurse until this year. I know that the acceptance rate is really low and only a few get in...but I was wondering if anyone had transferred from a four-year university to UCLA School of Nursing before and if so, how did you do it? Any advice? all transfers ik are are from a community college, or left a 4 year then went to a cc then transfered. you should also look into the MECN program. That‚Äôs gonna be SUPER difficult. Good luck i‚Äôm not a nursing major but i transferred form a UC! feel free to message me Just apply into the MECN (masters) program. No previous healthcare experience is necessary. What time does early RSU start on March 6th?  8am PSA: Dining hall lockers For starters, idk how some of you have the balls to put your backpacks out in the open and unlocked for anyone to steal. But if you‚Äôre going to do that, PLEASE don‚Äôt use perfectly working lockers to put your backpack in. At least use a broken one, or leave it on the ground or smth.  I can‚Äôt tell you the amount of times I‚Äôve tried to find an open locker to LOCK my valuables in(to no avail), only for 10+ of them to be unlocked, but with someone‚Äôs stuff in them. What a waste of space.   If you‚Äôre going to not lock your valuables, please don‚Äôt take a locker that actually locks :/ would be nice but I think people who are too lazy to spend 5 seconds locking the door aren't going to go out of their way to look for broken ones My intrusive thoughts tell me to lock them and scramble the combination My bag is too big for bplate specifically, so i leave it outside Dawg those lockers are so janky I‚Äôve almost not been able to open them like twice when I locked it. But still feels less like someone will steal if it‚Äôs at least inside a locker rather than on the ground. But I also agree that those like myself should put bags in broken lockers if possible This tho; I started taking people‚Äôs bags out of those lockers and putting them into broken ones nearby if I wasn‚Äôt able to find an empty useable one I mean nobody steals them Half of them are broken tho lol Now your intrusive thoughts are my intrusive thoughts Life hack: use bfit lockers stop touching other people's shit Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.  I have checked 1,345,563,900 comments, and only 258,671 of them were in alphabetical order. Mf then leave ur shit on the ground if only it were just half. :| And now your intrusive thoughts from OP‚Äôs intrusive thoughts are my intrusive thoughts Didnt even think about that lol. But id spend too much effort to walk down and walk back up. Too lazy shhhh don't tell them I lock mine, I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not that deep someone make a group chat so we can start a terrorist organization Bruh all I‚Äôm saying is if u don‚Äôt wanna lock ur shit don‚Äôt prevent someone else who wants to lock their shit from doing so üò≠ I don‚Äôt care if you actually lock it or not anyone doing the global internship program? dm me, curious to chat with other people about it. especially if engineering I am! Not engineering though. Any recent dental grads willing to talk about their experience? I graduated last year and I'm heavily considering applying to dental school. UCLA would b my number 1 bc I already know the area and would be saving hundreds of thousands. I don't know anyone who graduated (besides a dentist i tried to shadow who warned me not to go into dental school ): ) so I'd love to ask some questions from a recent grad if anyone is down (: Scheduling advice Is taking stats 10 and math 31b in the same quarter doable for a student who's not stem-inclined? Math 31b with Xiong and stats 10 with Cha. M) I can‚Äôt speak for 31B but stats 10 is a breeze, especially with Cha. Basically everyone gets an A in the class so you‚Äôll be fine in that class. 31B is probably gonna be a struggle if you‚Äôre not great at math but if you devote a lot of time and effort to it, you should do fine I've taken math 31b and the class is mehh. It's a lot of memorization methods on solving integrals, such as the Taylor Series and whatnot. If calculus is easy for you, then given the previous comment, both classes should be doable. However, Xiong does have a 3.5 rating on bruin walk, so that might be something you want to factor if you're still deciding. Interesting minors for a CS major I've really begun to hate both Math and Physics (lower-divs just feel like plug and chug and grunt work). I've always been interested in things like theoretical Chemistry and also CS (why I'm studying it), as it's really intuitive to me. Is there any minors I could pursue along those lines?  I've been considering Math: 115A -> 131A -> 170A -> 164 -> 156, but given how lower-divs feel, I'm worried of more of the same. I'd only do it if its a lot more theory. Upper div math is literally theory. The 115, 131, 170 series are largely proof based.   Honestly, why don‚Äôt you consider a minor in philosophy? Proof based math and philosophy are surprisingly similar in practice, and a CS major with a philosophy background is really unique. I know a couple people who majored/minored in philosophy and now work in tech administration because philosophy is a very analytical field and shows you really know how to think.  Personally I wouldn‚Äôt do math if I were you. First off, some of the math classes you listed (164, 156) are just the math departments version of CS equivalents (machine learning, algorithms, optimization, etc). Honestly idk how these are different from CS classes. i don't think CS has an optimization and machine learning. i had thought that was mostly math-based Of course CS has those types of courses.   https://registrar.ucla.edu/academics/course-descriptions?search=Com%20sci  The stats department also has one or two, if that‚Äôs interesting to you. Looking to make a single pod RSU group (girls)! Hi! Pretty self-explanatory! I'm aiming to get into a single-pod dorm this next year, and I know forming roommate groups with others who are requesting that also gives all of us a bit of better chance.

Lost iPhone Someone left an iPhone at Yoshinoya . If it‚Äôs yours tell me what kind of iPhone is it and what color. Also have to unlock it before you take it. Older Gentleman Near Drake Stadium No this isn‚Äôt about a creepy guy that hangs out by Drake Stadium. Pretty often on my way down the hill by Drake Stadium I see an older gentleman with a brown hat and a cane that just sits there and watches the students pass. I usually see him earlier in the day, anywhere from maybe 8-12. I‚Äôve grown accustomed to see him there and it actually kind of makes my day to see him just chilling and seeing the students pass. I was just curious as to who he was. I think from time to time I‚Äôve seen hime accompanied by a younger person, maybe an assistant or something, idk. He‚Äôs a white elderly man that I think has glasses. Nothing creepy about him, I think I‚Äôve even seen him wave at students as they pass by but he mainly just relaxes and sits there and was just curious in knowing if anyone else knows who he is. Awwww, to be a new Bruin.   &#x200B;  That guy used to have two big dogs. Everyone would pet them. Then over COVID, supposedly the dogs passed away. Now, I've since graduated, but sounds like this same guy still enjoys perusing campus. Cute. His name is Paul, he‚Äôs actually really sweet if you stop and talk to him! Used to bring two dogs with him, Elvis and princess, but I haven‚Äôt been on campus recently to see if they‚Äôre still around. Elvis was pretty old but Princess was younger. &nbsp;  He definitely favors talking to athletes and women, but I‚Äôve still had some great conversations with him and his dogs are very well behaved and cute if you ever see him with them! I saw him last quarter with a 30s aged Asian guy who was literally holding the man‚Äôs belt from behind as he walked. I‚Äôve seen him alone most of the time tho. I‚Äôm guessing the man with him is some sort of nurse assistant or something? But I thought it was so strange to have his fingers hooked in his belt like he was just gonna take off LOL I remember people posting here talking about how he is actually a creep and uses the dogs to talk to girls. Not sure how true it is but you should be able to find those posts if you search it in this sub i‚Äôve wondered about him as well‚Ä¶ before enrolling, i remember hearing about the husky guy, a dude who walked 2 huskies on campus all the time. was that him?! Hm I‚Äôm 99% sure I‚Äôve heard stories of this dude being an absolute creep and weirdo when I was a student. Definitely heard some women say he‚Äôd say weird stuff and that he clearly favored talking to women.   The dogs were apparently his daughters so maybe they‚Äôre still alive. Yeah, I‚Äôve never actually seen him with his dogs so it may be possible. But I always wondered if he was just someone important in the school culture or if he just happened to live near by but him and Andre are like the only two people you‚Äôll have a pretty good chance of seeing if visiting campus, although Andre has been lacking a bit lately. Yeah I think that might be him, I‚Äôve never actually stopped to talk to him and I‚Äôve never seen him with his dogs but it‚Äôs almost like a morning ritual when going to class, like it makes the morning feel complete. I don't think just talking to girls is creepy, especially if they approach him, even if it's because of the dogs.    I haven't heard of him approaching anyone, unlike Andre. Just search husky in this sub Yes MS Quantitative Economics at UCLA Hi. Has anyone received admit for MS in Quantitative Economics at UCLA for Fall'23? Looking to form/join an RSU group for a 2bd/3 person apartment I want to get the 2 bed/3 person single bedroom, so I‚Äôm looking to either join or form an RSU group for early RSU. The other two roommates would be in the double. I‚Äôm a third year female undergraduate student. I don‚Äôt drink or smoke and I would prefer my roommates to not drink or smoke either. I keep to myself and I‚Äôm very introverted. Please let me know if anyone is interested! pussy Lol good luck Physics at Community College I'm dying in 1A rn and I want to take 1b & possibly 1c in community college over the summer. Is this something you would recommend and do you know if you can also get 4AL credit? I'm a chemical engineering major btw i did a cc class that counted for both 1b and 4bl also because i struggled in 1a. since i‚Äôm cs physics kinda has nothing to do with the rest of my classes so it was fine, i ended up taking 1c here and it wasn‚Äôt too hard Hi, I transferred here from CC and the physics courses in my CC contained both lecture and lab. I took the equivalent of Physics 1B & 4BL in the summer and it definitely worked, saving me a LOT of headache by clearing two classes. I highly recommend it; the first half of physics 1C is super easy after taking summer E&M Physics (at least in Semester system). look up transferology Why are people on the hill so loud? I was taking a dump and three guys burst into the bathroom practically screaming talking about some party they had gone too. Like, glad you had a good time. Do you have to shout this at the top of your lungs in an enclosed space?  It happens often. People do it in elevators and in stairwells. Why? It's as if people like the attention. Please shut the fuck up. You are in public. if it was after 1AM on a Friday they were probably drunk, just hill things Here‚Äôs a good example I can recall while being at ucla.   https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/spmg1s/an_open_letter_to_the_girl_on_the_phone_with_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf math 32b with r. wong do you recommend him? how is his class?   the other 32b professor is do,k I‚Äôm in 32b rn, but had Wong for 31b last quarter. He was very fair and ur grade relied a lot less on tests than other professors. He had with two grading schemes and was generous with partial credit. His teaching style is good, but he doesn‚Äôt do a lot of teaching exercises in class, so the midterm will be rough if u didn‚Äôt do work outside the class. He also gave no hw, but I think this hurt me in the end as I didn‚Äôt do a lot of work outside lectures. Overall I recommend him.  My friend has do this quarter and his first midterm was rough, so I can‚Äôt really comment on him. Took 32b with Richard Wong. I didn‚Äôt love the class because he does so few examples during class, but he‚Äôs only in his second year of teaching so he has a unique syllabus. IIRC, the grades are based solely of off discussion worksheets, midterms, and projects. The project is essentially a more complex problem of something we learned in class, and they involving proving some famous Calc Theorems. The first one was kind of hard but the second was ok. Because hw is not graded, you really need to be diligent to succeed on the midterms because there is a ton of problems he assigns each lecture. If you can do all of them the midterms will be ok but definitely still difficult. Can I handle two math elective in same summer session? ü§Ø It really depends on which ones If you don‚Äôt have anything else going on, yes. It‚Äôs not gonna be fun, but you will survive. How about cs 32 and stats100a I‚Äôm not familiar with the summer course load of cs but I think one of these classes is 8 weeks long and the other 6. how do i make friends if i have depression? Ive had depression since high school. Im now a 4th year, and have no friends. I dont know how to do it. I try to connect with people but then idk how to talk or what to talk about, in the end i feel like they either start avoiding me because i generally feel really empty and they can sense that or im just incredibly uninteresting. I try my best to be genuine and kind and caring, i ask about others and how they're doing and if i can do anything for them if they're going through something.   I really, really tried for 4 years to make friends, and i couldnt. I know theres probably something else wrong with me but idk what. How do i do it? How do i make a friend? Other people are saying work on yourself first, which I completely agree with. To add on, you say that you feel uninteresting. So make yourself interesting. Find some hobby like underwater basket weaving - even better if that hobby has a tight community. Once you do that, friends should come naturally since you‚Äôll end up finding people with similar interests who you can connect with. You need to focus on yourself first. You need to love yourself before you can love others. Start by trying to treat/manage your depression. My parents always told me this and it‚Äôs harsh, but it‚Äôs true. If you don‚Äôt love yourself, it‚Äôll be hard for people to love you. It‚Äôll be hard for people to want to be around you. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm not saying people who are depressed don‚Äôt deserve love, and in fact it‚Äôs the complete opposite. People who are depressed really need the love and support, but you need to first work  on building yourself up. Become a person who you would want to be around. Exude the energy that you would want to receive from a friend.   I know because I‚Äôve been dealing with depression since high school as well. It never truly goes away, but I will say, I‚Äôve done a lot of work to get to the other side and I‚Äôm very proud of that. If you aren‚Äôt already in therapy, do that. If you need to get on medications, do that. Eat healthy and work out. Join clubs that interest you and will feed your mind. Who knows? Maybe you‚Äôll meet likeminded people! Take the initiative to organize times to meet with people, go out to dinner, etc. You have to make a change. Some things, like making friends, don‚Äôt always come naturally to people. The first step is accepting that and not beating yourself up over it. Realize that it‚Äôs absolutely okay! You‚Äôll maybe just have to take a few additional steps. What‚Äôs wrong with that? Nothing!  If you have a hard time thinking of things to talk about or continuing conversation, ask people questions about themselves. People generally love talking about themselves.   Lastly, one thing that really helped me is to stop thinking so much. Depression and anxiety are beasts. They make you question every facet of your being. Don‚Äôt give them that power. It‚Äôs certainly easier said than done, but it requires practice. Right when you realize you‚Äôre thinking things like ‚Äúthey must think I‚Äôm boring‚Äù or ‚Äúshit, did I say something wrong? I must‚Äôve said something wrong. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre not texting me anymore.‚Äù Just stop yourself, and realize that most people don‚Äôt care or have the time to analyze every word you‚Äôre saying with a fine toothed comb. Just relax. Stop thinking so much. Just say fuck it, move on, and try again. Don‚Äôt tell yourself narratives that won‚Äôt serve you well.   I‚Äôm rooting for you OP! You‚Äôve got this! This doesn't exactly answer your question but some advice someone told me is to look for that sweet spot between meaningful socialization and being comfortable alone in your feelings (which is easier said than done).  I think UCLA can be hard because it's easy to feel alone among so many people. Also you have to remember that a lot of the negative things you feel is your depression lying to you. I think it‚Äôs okay to struggle to make friends, it does not mean that you are wrong or that something is inherently wrong with you. I think journaling can help, free-writing helps me get flow of words and feels quite relieving. I think the ‚Äúwork on yourself‚Äù advice can be much easier to realize when you imagine a time where your innate self can fit in naturally with your environment. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad to just hang out/do something with someone without feeling the pressure to say a bunch of things and come up with super clever topics. Wouldn‚Äôt the lack of pressure be awesome?  I‚Äôm in the same boat with dealing with depression and loneliness as a third year, and think my lack of pro activity due to fear of humiliation and rejection has held me back tremendously at UCLA. I‚Äôd be down to listening to you more if you would like to chat about your experience. Hey dude I have depression too on my last year since the beginning of college ill be ur fwend :3 fr tho u need to make taking care of ur self a priority and making friends comes secondary Does UCLA offer scholarships to international students? How do international students afford UCLA? I am a prospective undergraduate student, and I have wanted to go to UCLA all my life, but I have been receiving mixed information on whether or not UCLA offers scholarships to international students, undergraduate or graduate. If not, how do international students afford it? Is there any financial aid at all or is it just rich parents? no scholarships or money for internationals. pretty sure all of us pay out of pocket Tbh rich parents. My parents paid everything for my undergrad, i pay for grad on my own by fellowship (pays half of intl tuition+stipend) but i still have to borrow money from parents. I also make a tiny bit more than other intl students cuz after 5 years of residency, u get lower taxes. If u do phd, they cover full intl tuition after you pass preliminary exams. If u cant afford it dont come because like while my parents paid everything, i literally spent $100 on dinner every other day and didnt care shit but now i cant even afford a $1 canned coke and honestly its superrrr stressful to constantly have these financial problems ur academics will suffer. No actually. If UCLA did so, I don't think the parents in LA would tolerate it. They paid taxes and taxes feed UCLA. I‚Äôm an undergrad and there‚Äôs no financial aid, scholarships, student loans, or grants offered for internationals. You can become an RA for free housing and meal plan but the tuition itself (around 15500 usd per quarter, plus summer will be totaling 50000 usd a year) cannot be deducted. One option is to take private loans themselves or through their family, but every international I know affords through their parents/family. Before you even enroll in classes, you have to provide a bank statement to prove you have enough funds in your bank account to fund your education. Even for graduate programs? I can not find anything about scholarships for international students other than undergraduate programs. Damn, well thanks, and good luck. i‚Äôm undergrad so i can‚Äôt really say, but i imagine it‚Äôs the same. ucla is a public school which i think makes a difference because of fafsa/ us not being citizens. but yea when you get your F1 you have to prove you have a certain amount in your bank account to pay the fees otherwise you can‚Äôt get it. so yea rich parents is unfortunately it letter of recommendation will it matter if i get a B in the class and the professor writes my letter of recommendation for my master‚Äôs? like rather than getting an A in the class, like will they care for that? or would it be weird and they‚Äôre gonna be like why did she get a letter of recommendation for a class that she got a B in? It really depends on your circumstances and relationship with the prof.   I had a class I got less than an A in and that prof wrote me a great letter of rec, but that won't always be the case. I do think it helped a little to offset the grade. At the end of the day, a prof that knows your work and can speak well and highly of it and you is what you want, regardless of a grade. Its not weird but you have to make sure to ask them if they can write you a ‚Äústrong‚Äù rec letter. I had to write one for my student and it def helped that she got an A cuz i cud mention that in the letter but if the prof has smth else good to say about u that‚Äôd help. And maybe u already know and it doesnt matter so much for masters as much as phd, but u shud try to get rec letter from a prof who is good friends with the prof in the dept ure applying under. it is weird i think. because the recommenders are most likely to write something based on truth. is there anything else more obvious than a B? is it possible to sneak into the music building and use their drum set to practice for free?  Im sorry To the girl at the study that I passed out on. I‚Äôm so sorry my blood sugar was low and I was fainting. w rizz? LMFAO Lmao this reminds me when I chanced upon a drunk puking girl coming back from a party and sprawled on the sidewalk, whom I bridal carried to safety. When I got back to my dorm my friends asked me if I got her number or anything lmao. Of course not, the story ends there and the girl was not conscious enough to know who carried her. Hopefully she‚Äôs doing okay username checks out Sigma simp Summer Classes Overlap Hi! Hope midterms are going well ;)   I‚Äôm planning on taking courses during summer session but 2 of the classes I want to take overlap with each other (one starts at 10, the other starts at 10:45)   will I be able to enroll into them even if they overlap?       Thank you <3   contexts: they are both online if that helps lol I think it's allowed, like you'll get a warning before enrolling just to make sure you're aware of the overlap but as long as you click the agree or acknowledge button at the bottom of the message you should be able to enroll just fine. I'm kind of doing the exact same lol. Thank you üíó Please don‚Äôt be a bitch As i was getting stuff from the cpo food closet today, there was a group of three 20-yr old ish kids (no more description. End.) trying to cut the line. Someone said to them that they should go to the back of the line. Well they came to the back of the line and the girl said ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only 2 girls why does it matter if we cut them HAHA‚Äù and the 2 guys were like ‚Äúyeah lol‚Äù. And the girl said ‚Äúwell I mean we‚Äôre not starving we can afford food but you know, just hungry haha‚Äù. I just ignored them cuz they not worth my time but then after i came out, the girl suddenly speeded and walked towards me bumped her shoulder to me intentionally and I was in agony from the pain but she started laughing at me and the guys started laughing too. 1. Please don‚Äôt make fun of people who are struggling to afford food.  2. Don‚Äôt intentionally bump into someone and laugh at them just because you think its funny seeing people hurt. 3. Don‚Äôt cut the line. I‚Äôm so sorry your parents didn‚Äôt teach you common sense. 4. You two guys are so beta. Just agreeing with the girl because you have no better friends? You‚Äôre a jokeüòÇ 5. If you were the ones today, I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre so insecure that you have to hurt other people. Please accept my sincere condolences. I would be worried if I were you too.  P.S. the person you just made fun of today may be more rich than you. Don‚Äôt judge a book by its cover. Treat everyone fairly.  Thanks for listening to my rant. \"kids\" fucking grown ass adults acting like complete fucking a-holes. What a joke. Sorry you had to encounter these bitches. See I have anger issues if she tried that crap with me I would have cussed that b outüòÇ. Don‚Äôt worry OP she‚Äôll try her crap with the wrong one some day. Nasty bitch Wish her ass was recorded or some shit to put her on blast fr fr, she needa stay out of the CPO as if she can ‚Äúafford food‚Äù and wants to make fun of others who are less fortunate she probably doesn‚Äôt belong there??? People like these 3 anger tf outta me Just know that I feel you & I promise we are not all like this. We do not claim them. They're garbage. Theres actually a lot of narcissistic people at this school. UCLA brand gets to their head. I grew up always thinking that bullies in American movies were not a real reflection of reality but maybe they are Step up or step off, should‚Äôve tripped her. Majority of humansüòÄ Why did you specify her race üòÇ Her race had nothing to do with what happened in this story. The fact that you had to specify that she was Indian shows that you are racist. You didn‚Äôt specify the race of either of the guys and if you really needed to say her race to identify the girl as you claim, there are many other things you could have said to describe her. The fact that you have to hide behind a screen to say this says a lot about you. Just a woman hating on women. They‚Äôre definitely lucky it wasn‚Äôt me. They would have dialed 911 on themselves. Punk b*tches. Let me buy you a coffee! Leave it to Karma. These princesses will get it in the end. Even if it comes in the form of adulterino husbands who stopped loving them long ago üòé keep your head up and be about you they were just feeling ashamed and pretended to be offensive. but still cowards hhh. Aye man im glad I wasn't tripping people are dicks and that's why you gotta check em then they get mad and start being uncivil that's where I get to smacking mfrs -_- We don't claim them!!!! U couldn‚Äôt stand up for yourself irl so u make a Reddit post ab it? Not hating but I wouldn‚Äôt take that disrespect University students have many insecurities, and food insecurity is a big one Thanks i feel better nowüôèüèº Yeah i did yell out ‚Äúu fucking bitch‚Äù which i admit was immature on my part but if I let it slide, she‚Äôll continue hurting others. I wish id done more but I have a lot to lose (friends, time, money, job, reputation,etc). She doesnt have anything to lose which is why she can do thatüòÇ and thanks i hope soüôèüèº Thanks bro u make me feel betterüò£ Thanks at least ik y‚Äôall are decent gives me hope. Its time for humans to get dash cams while walkingüò≠ Thank you tooü´∂üèª Ah you wish. I call it the Los Angeles effect.   Every major metropolitan area has a specific‚Ä¶ vibe. And Los Angeles has a lot of ‚Äúfuck you I got mine‚Äù energy. I wish I was carrying something big and solid so that when she hit me it would only hurt her not me lol True smhüò≠ Sorry my bad, nothing deep. I was in so much shock that I don‚Äôt remember anything that identifies them so I wrote down anything I can remember about them. I mean she was wearing no sleeves and black long brazilian straightened hair but its not like she‚Äôs gonna wear the same clothes. I dont even remember the guys except they were prob taller than 5‚Äù4 at least. [deleted] If I were you I‚Äôd look at the other comments before making up conclusions and falsely accusing someone of being racist. The fact that you have to hide behind a screen says a lot about you. The fact that you have to mention ‚Äújust a woman hating on women‚Äù you have to mention ‚Äújust a woman‚Äù, I never even mentioned I‚Äôm a woman lol. I can say the same thing for you and accuse you for being sexist and it‚Äôs purely logical don‚Äôt u think? Oh and I guess you don‚Äôt care about people getting physically hurt or people making fun of others for not being able to afford food because this is all part of ‚Äújust a woman hating on women‚Äù right? You can join that group, you‚Äôd get along really well. Thanks T\\_T Thank u! Thanks :) Yoo radiooo! Haha thanks I mean what am i gonna do, those kids been raised under cuckoo parents and been living stupid for 20yrs, she‚Äôs not worth the fight. Better telling other ppl so they can watch out for dumbasses like this. Yeah LA does and I guess it's kinda expected since there's just so many people. Mmh she spoke pretty good english. It‚Äôs disappointing she‚Äôs using the language to create enemies not friends but i guess u gotta do what u gotta do to look strong so u can hide ur insecurities right?üòÇ there‚Äôs no way the only thing you remembered was her race ü§£ü§£ How altruistic of you. Here I can repeat a comment I already wrote. Obviously i remember the guys were at least 5‚Äù4 but i dont even know their hair color they‚Äôre standing behind me and too scared to look at them. Ik the girl wore no sleeves with hair straightened done but thats literally all i remember. I dont even know if she was taller than me. If u wanna keep arguing about race, go for it. But that‚Äôs all I remember so I‚Äôm not going to deal with your argument. It‚Äôs just my old age lol having more things to protect in life please dont come to library or common study area if you are coughing at least wear mask  what have we learned the past three years Some of us have heartburn Especially classes. Don‚Äôt come to class if you are dripping snot and having juicy coughs ffs.   Kid in blue and grey striped tshirt in bunche for math 32b today. I saw you on Reddit during lecture as you juicy coughed into your hand for the entire lecture and then slicked back your hair with that same hand every time you coughed‚Ä¶.  I hope you see this. At least wear a mask next time..   ‚Ä¶nasty ass mfers No, I don‚Äôt think I will sometimes mans gotta print   ^despite how you should still wear a mask  you all have gotten your panties into way too much of a bunch over people simply experiencing bodily functions   grow up Of course, go ahead and get your printing done.       But understand that one of these days you gotta get that smooth brain of yours and developed past the preoperational stage and realize there are other people that exist besides you, and your sexist remark is not okay.       If you have bodily-function problems, manage it like a responsible adult. Don‚Äôt make it other people‚Äôs problem. Even a 5 year old learns to cover their mouth and wash their hands.         Grow up. sexist remark? can men not wear panties? if you have to cough, what? what do adults do? they cough?  35 clowns  its pretty obvious who has the smooth brain if you have issues with people coughing politely   grow up Yes, sexist remark. Your comment about people getting their panties in a bunch. You act like a child blaming the dog for drawing on the wall with a crayon. All us ‚Äúclowns‚Äù saw your comment and you trying to play coy is obvious. ‚ÄúcAn MeN nOt WeAr PaNtiEs?‚Äù        Since you clearly must be a child, I‚Äôll tell you what adults do when they have to cough. They do the same thing 5 year olds do. They cover their mouth. Use the crook of your arm if it‚Äôs a one-off incident. If you‚Äôre sick and haven‚Äôt managed to make any friends with your lack of consideration of others and you must go to the library yourself to print, then find a mask and wear it like a good little obedient government sheeple.   Edit: grow up Not a sexist remark. Grow up.  Reread your comment. You sound like a child.

Help me I would suggest really really learning the proofs for the theorems/ homeworks etc. As in learn the logic line by line. Then you can practice and rewrite them until you can do it from memory.    It may seem tedious and a ton of work but after a while you‚Äôll start to pick up the general flow on how to approach problems. In order to create/come up with sound proofs you gotta first learn what solid proofs look like (just like how all chefs start out by mimicking classic dishes, or how famous composers first master previous pieces before creating their own). 115A is tough but you got it! Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt do well on the first midterm - it‚Äôll get better. Good luck! Try to actually have an intuition for all the major results, so they just 'feel right' to you. Whenever you read a theorem always think of examples, and consider why all the conditions it lays out are necessary.  Then, lots of exercises. I highly recommend reading the proofs for the theorems and corollaries. Those proofs often have hints for the proofs that show up on the exams. Plus like others said you start to learn the logic and gain a sense of intuition. Also, it helps when you start a proof to read what you‚Äôre given and just start writing anything thats implied from that even if it‚Äôs just a definition. To study for proof based classes I like making little webs of how different thinks connect to each other ie if A is ‚Äúclosed‚Äù what other things could that imply. And I also like starting from either end of the proof and trying to work backwards Talk to yourself! I always try to explain concepts to myself when I study. It‚Äôll help a lot with reenforcing things you know and putting knowledge about general topics together. 1) I would go to office hours as often as possible. Even if you have no prepared questions. Getting that additional exposure to the subject material helps a lot and seeing how someone else would approach a problem differently might open you up to more strategies for yourself.  2) When you're doing homework, write all the theorems/axioms/propositions you end up using onto a separate piece of paper. That way, you have a study guide being constantly updated with all the seemingly pertinent reference material for exams and other homework. And when you write them down, reread them until you understand why it works. You'd be surprised by how easily accessible the information will be in your brain if you're able to understand the logic and convince yourself that it works.

I‚Äôm sorry this post offended you and I‚Äôm sorry how you thought it would be reasonable to use a person‚Äôs skin color as a basis for your argument. How you gonna make a shitpost that had nothing to do with race into some sort of racial issue then make yourself a victim. You sound miserable. Bro. Obviously you were born blind‚Ä¶ this Andre dude is a fucken scammer. Doesn‚Äôt matter what the fuck the color of is his skin is‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a fraud. Always has been always will be. [deleted] üíÄüíÄüíÄ for reallll [deleted] HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH HAHAAHHAHA You‚Äôre the one who brought skin color into this thread. Not once did I mention skin color, stereotypes, or DIRECTLY being scammed by Andre. YOU chose to talk about race and stereotypes in YOUR response. I‚Äôm sorry you got ‚Äúharassed‚Äù and that have a different definition of what that means, truly I am.   You‚Äôre creating this own narrative in your head in an attempt to make me sound racist and insensitive.  And honestly, if he has an active permit to solicit, as you say so, he‚Äôs DEFINITELY needs to find a new place to solicit because asking college students clearly is not the move. If he wants to make some money for his ‚Äúorganization‚Äù or whatever he represents, UCLA‚Äôs BruinWalk is the last place he should be. You can‚Äôt take criticism and hate being proven wrong about something you brought up into the argument yourselfüíÄ I‚Äôm sure a handful of colored people have read this post, yet not once did they find it racist or deem my post as racist with malicious intent regarding the stereotype‚Ä¶.wait for it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.That you mentioned and brought up yourself [deleted] [deleted] Andre could be white and people would still talk the way they about him. this has nothing to do with skin color or stereotypes of Black people being criminals. If you‚Äôre so pressed, go join him and advocate for his organization, and prove me wrong Please remind me what NAACP stands for? I forgot‚Ä¶. Colored people as in POC,,,,African American, afro-Latin American, Indian,‚Ä¶.. anyone who is not white. You‚Äôre reading it out of context and you implying that Andre is black is a bit racist and insensitive. He can be Afro-Latin American, he can be quite anything if you want to bring race into this again. You really thought you did something there. [deleted] [deleted] Yeah a pic of your face came up I‚Äôll wait for your rebuttal. You cant get upset at me when it‚Äôs still being used by an organization that is meant to represent the fight for equality for the demographic YOU identify with. Maybe email them to change the name to NAAPOC? That‚Äôs a start [deleted] There‚Äôs no point in arguing with you. You‚Äôre still gonna spew pointless/invalid arguments out of your mouth in an attempt to provoke your victim story. I apologize for using the outdated term that I previously used, and will not use it again.   But back to my argument, if it‚Äôs outdated, why is that term used by an organization that is meant to represent POC? You have absolutely, and I mean absolutely, no leverage over my usage of those words when it‚Äôs STILL in the fucking name of an organization that represents POC. To be clear, I used it in the same context as it‚Äôs meaning in NAACP.   You‚Äôre just livid and pressed that i invalidated your argument by using an example that is absolutely appropriate and factual/historical.   You lost this argument. Get over it. Girly, they ate you tf up with that response. Scrum diddly yum yum, a purr purr [deleted] You said it yourself‚Ä¶ THAT TERM IS NOT INHERENTLY RACISTüíÄüò≠    Thank you for invalidating your argument and supporting my argument of me not being racist/prejudiceü´∂üèºüôèüèº [deleted] Im black. And the friend that I just made read this whole thread is black. We both went to UCLA and are familiar w/ Andre, and found no racism in the original post and actually LOL'd since it reminded us of him and how he annoyed tf out of us. When the OP used \"colored people\" to describe POC, it was a little WTF moment, yeah, but doesn't necessarily make them racist. I can kinda see the OPs logic and where they were coming from when referring to minorities and underrepresented individuals as that term, but if its still in the name of the NAACP that once/and still represents one of the greatest activism for civil rights for POC like you and I. I have no issue with them using that word **if** used in the appropriate way (which they did). You were too quick to assume the diction it was used in and now you look stupid. If there was something racist said by the OP prior to using the words colored people, then that makes them racist imo. You honestly need to shut up and take a breather, its not that serious. You're making a fool out of yourself. Because you and I are the only people bickering on this thread, your downvotes, the list goes on.  Amazing of you to assume I‚Äôm white, my little Reddit activist. [deleted] Yeah you're one of those stupid fucking people. but just an FYI there weren't any racist undertones in the original post. like at all. Everyone will have a different definition of racism, but i think the place where you fucked up was by insinuating this post was off basis of racist undertones, and a bunch of people appear to disagree with you. Just get off reddit and do something a bit more productive then if you think everyone is stupid asf on here. clearly it entertains you enough. Rombes or Bauer? Physics 5A I want to take physics 5A over the summer since I have absolutely no physics experience. Who‚Äôs the better professor for 5A? Rombes is great, his lectures are interesting and the exams are also not that difficult since he provides all the equations on the exam you just need to know when to apply each equation. I had Bauer for physics 1ah and have him now for physics 1b. He‚Äôs a great lecturer, but doesn‚Äôt do problems in lecture really. He zooms all his classes. For exams u get a full sheet of paper front and back to write whatever u want. The tests can be a bit tricky as you need to use a bit of creativity for the problems.

Jerk chicken is literally Jamaican food, and black people in the South adapted West African cooking techniques and combined it with scottish techniques to what was available to make Louisiana fried chicken.

I‚Äôm just panicking, if anybody has experience w this I would appreciate any input ! Dropping below 12 units once per year does not immediately impact housing if you have a valid reason. Not sure about financial aid, but I remember seeing something like it may reduce at a prorated amount the financial aid but not eliminate it. Try to reach out to your RA who probably has access to more information about the housing. i dropped below the unit cap multiple times while in school, as long as it‚Äôs passed the financial aid audit deadline you‚Äôll be fine I believe you‚Äôre OK because FAFSA has already done their check, I dropped below 12 week 7 of winter 2022, I was alright Looking for the Guy with the Cool Jacket He had a really cool yellow jacket with a drawing like [this](https://imgur.com/a/tfAUazw) (excuse the bad art skills) on the back, and the side had like \"fresh eggs\" or something. it was incredibly dope and I'd love to know the name of the artist or place you got it from :D Shein eeb 185 w Lozano couldnt find anything on bruinwalk how is it? Is it too late to change my major? I‚Äôm a gender studies major but I want to switch or double in sociology. I am a transfer and I have the reqs filled but idk if it will be too heavy of course load if I do it now. Has anyone done it? Thoughts? I‚Äôm a junior btw I‚Äôm also a transfer and I decided to double, I had the recs for my second major done previously. I mapped out all my classes (I have to take a full schedule this summer as well) and it works out fine. It‚Äôs a 4 classes several quarter type of deal, but seems cool.   I see you‚Äôre also planning to go to law school (me too)  I‚Äôm debating making one a minor now to focus on the lsat and keep my gpa high but it‚Äôs a hard decision cuz I have an ego and I wanna double for the flex lmao First look into which ever department, academic advisors, or admins you need to contact with to talk to about swapping/double majors. They will advise/give you the info to see if your plans are doable. **I'm gonna emphasize that if you're seriously looking into swapping or double majoring go to academic counselors/advisors they will be the best source of help.** In your free time, you can read the bruinwalk reviews for the courses you'll have to take.   Here's my guess: Worse case scenario you end up spending another quarter or two or maybe even a year. It's your call. No shame for spending more time to complete your courses. I had two roommates (not transfers but swapped majors during junior year, one was business/econ to linguistics computer science and another computer science to biology) who had to spend more time to complete their upper divs to graduate. The only other concern would be being over the unit limit for graduation but you'll have to talk to your academic advisor on that one. That should be fine especially if you're not in college honors, but I'd recommend going to your counseling office (CAC, AAP, Honors) to map out a course plan Genuinely curious. Why did you choose gender studies and what do you study in that? It may be doable if you‚Äôre a pre-soc major already and complete the eleven required courses in the time before you graduate Don‚Äôt worry, regardless of whether you end up double majoring or not you‚Äôll end up unemployed so it won‚Äôt even matter!! I thought I liked it a lot because of women‚Äôs studies but I realize I prefer a more broad view of society as far as my studies go.

Asking for a friend Scootering around UCLA There have been quite a few frustrating traffic incidents I've run into while scootering at UCLA, and I'd just like to vent to get them off my mind. Thinking about AITA is preventing me from focusing on my schoolwork. I feel like these incidents are a combination of bad driving (my scooter driving included) and terrible bike/traffic infrastructure. Here are the incidents and their locations (note that my descriptions may be biased):  * [https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0703131,-118.4549518,3a,75y,234.71h,85.97t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sRlxWzsGfbl6BKfGCWVbC7Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192](https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0703131,-118.4549518,3a,75y,234.71h,85.97t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sRlxWzsGfbl6BKfGCWVbC7Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192)    * At the intersection between Gayley and Veteran, there are no green lights for the left turn. The green light for me and the cars on the opposite side were both on. I was trying to turn left, and the car (call it car A) on the opposite side was waiting for me to turn. The car behind it (call it car B), however, tried to squeeze by to make a right turn onto the road I was trying turn onto. I stopped in the middle of the intersection because I didn't want to crash into car B, and cars began honking at me. * [https://www.google.com/maps/@34.06899,-118.4549167,3a,75y,140.76h,86.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sh3I5NeDBelycXTnZypoz1Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192](https://www.google.com/maps/@34.06899,-118.4549167,3a,75y,140.76h,86.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sh3I5NeDBelycXTnZypoz1Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192)    * Ever since the intersection incident, I've decided to just turn left using the crosswalk since the crosswalk actually signals pedestrians when they can turn left (I'm a pedestrian when I hop off my scooter). But turning left with the crosswalk means that I end up riding on the sidewalk. When scootering within 15 feet of someone on the sidewalk, I slow down to a jogging pace \\~5 mph, but here's what happened: (1) someone was walking towards me, keeping left of the sidewalk, (2) a runner behind the walker was also running towards me, and (3) I was keeping to the right.    * The runner wants to pass the walker, so I go further right onto the grass to slow down and get off my scooter. But the runner also decided to go onto the grass at around the same time I ride into the grass. We almost run into each other, and he yells: \"fuck man!\" (imo, that was rude!) I apologize.    * I can understand his logic of how the scooter probably wouldn't ride into the grass, but I think the main problem was that *I* didn't act earlier enough. If he had seen me turn right into the grass earlier, this wouldn't have been an issue. Regardless, I think I'm going to continue riding on the sidewalk on that road... from my experience pedestrians here seem to have less of an issue with me than when they're in their cars. * [https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0703628,-118.4538192,3a,75y,246.14h,68.76t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sYz7hQQKBZ7Do2-64mFzSyw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192](https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0703628,-118.4538192,3a,75y,246.14h,68.76t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sYz7hQQKBZ7Do2-64mFzSyw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192)    * When turning left from Gayley onto Kelton (not an intersection), the problem with scootering is that it's very difficult to signal since it's very dangerous to lift one arm off your handle bars (much more so than bikes since the wheels on scooters are smaller). Before turning left, I ride to the right of the street, as according to the [LA County website](https://dcba.lacounty.gov/eridesafety/): \"if riding in the street, *ride* as far to the *right* as you can.\" I had to turn left, so I looked over my shoulder to see if I can ride to the middle of the street. Then, I turned onto Kelton without signaling and the car behind me honked at me.    * To be fair, there are signal lights I could buy; however, note that no ride-sharing scooter implements them, and according to [one reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/r620l2/why_arent_turn_indicators_standard_equipment_on/),       * \"Even ones that have it. They aren't effective. What's the difference between one blinking light or two. Drivers have no clue. In fact this is why in the USA the third brake light came into play. Because drivers could not tell the difference between a dim or bright red light.

If my scooter was half the width of a car, there would be no doubt that that would've been a crash.  Even so, my scooter has undoubtably been the one of the best purchases I've made at UCLA thus far! Hopefully I won't die on the roads regretting it! üòõ  BONUS: When riding on Charles E Young Drive West, I witnessed a crash between a scooter and a car. The person driving the scooter didn't stop at the stop sign, and I guess the driver could've been more vigilant. Luckily, the person driving the scooter only had minor injuries. I'll echo the other comment that scooters must make pedestrian-style left turns by California law. If you do not feel comfortable hand-signalling the turn, I highly recommend that you just follow the law. I have found that I feel comfortable making hand signals by (1) looking over my shoulder and judging that the car behind me is a safe distance away, (2) looking forward again, (3) hand signal for 2 seconds, (4) turn or lane change. Signalling *while* looking back makes me lose balance.   In your first scenario, I would have waved to give the car the right of way, since legally left turns always have to wait for traffic to clear. In your last scenario, it's the driver's fault. Cars must give 3 feet passing distance to scooters/bikes. Welcome to LA. People suck at driving here. As a scooter rider or bicyclist, it is your job to ride defensively, be visible, and act as if the cars are going to hit you at any moment‚Äî I feel like a lot of people who ride scooters just believe that they‚Äôre invincible, and that‚Äôs how you get hit. Compared to a bike, I would argue scooters are much more dangerous, because they‚Äôre motorized up to 20 mph and there‚Äôs no cushion for you if you get hit. If you can, always use hand signals when stopped. LA is one of the least bike-friendly cities in America. It's illegal to turn left on a scooter without dismounting and going on the crosswalk (CVC Section 21228(b)), probably since it's almost impossible to signal without losing your balance. I do it anyways but be prepared to follow the general flow of traffic for unprotected lefts (i.e. clearly signal your turn, if you have to stop in the middle of the intersection keep signalling your turning intentions so people can go around you until the light turns red.) People will honk at you but at least they're not running you over. Police have ticketed scooter riders before for improper left turns.  The best strat is to avoid unprotected left turns by planning your route accordingly. After looking up \"scooter\" on the UCLA subreddit, I have a hunch that the post will be criticized and downvoted to hell. üíÄ I live on the Kelton and the Gayley to Kelton left turn scares me EVERY TIME  I totally agree with these points tho I‚Äôve come across these before too I ain't reading all that I also scooter around campus. However, I use the sidewalks instead of busy roads (I always go slow when there‚Äôs people, also i don‚Äôt have my license yet) just because it‚Äôs a lot safer and getting into a traffic accident while on a scooter would probably result in a trip to the hospital for me lol.  Also, I‚Äôve also had similar encounters like u did with the runner. Sometimes I‚Äôll be scootering and I‚Äôll try to go around people, but all of a sudden they‚Äôll start walking left or right and I get a bit too close and almost crash into them. Once I was about to scooter across the crosswalk near math sciences and a guy on a bike decided it would be a good idea to go from the road onto the sidewalk near where I was standing and we crashed üíÄ not hard though so it was okay.   I‚Äôve never rlly crashed into ppl thank goodness, I try to go slow when I‚Äôm passing ppl on bruinwalk. I can understand why scooters can be annoying tho bc I see a lot of other ppl on scooters going rlly fast and almost hitting ppl, one girl on a bird even knocked the glasses off my face bc she scootered right past me super fast lmao I can‚Äôt rlly picture these in my head so idk if ur the asshole or not but it‚Äôs very likely that you were not the asshole. I park my car on veteran often and in order to pull up to parallel park, you have to slow down (obviously, I mean, unless anyone knows a way to parallel park while going 45mph the whole time lmao) and there were like 1 or 2 times where someone was behind me and honked at me. I didn‚Äôt stop abruptly or anything‚Äî I had started slowing down well in advance. they were just mad that I needed to park my car lmao. Idk how they thought honking would even help, I mean, I‚Äôm not gonna not park my car just because you couldn‚Äôt wait 20 seconds. Someone also honked at me before because I was going slow ‚Ä¶ BECAUSE THERE WAS A BIKER RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I guess they would‚Äôve preferred for me to kill the biker? so yeah, LA drivers are assholes In the first scenario, the car‚Äôs driver waved to give me the right of way. I would‚Äôve took it if it weren‚Äôt for the car behind it trying to turn onto the road I was turning onto. But either way, I‚Äôm still in the wrong since the left turn was illegal. üòï I am the opposite. I drive offensively, whether it is in my vehicle or on my motorcycle. This is the best form of defense. Oh wow, didn‚Äôt know it was illegal. Definitely makes sense though, considering what I experienced at the intersection before. How to become an organ donor 101 feasibility of taking 3 chem upper divs at once I'm hoping to take Chem 113A, Chem 172, and either Chem 136 or Chem 156. For the past two quarters I've only taken 2 chem upper divs at a time, wondering if anyone has done 3 and how their experience was? Or if anyone has feedback for these specific classes and their workloads.  I plan on only taking 3 classes next quarter btw (12-13 units). I do have extracurriculars but not enough that they get in the way of my studying. I'd ask a counselor about this but it's been impossible to get an appointment so far :/  Why are you taking Chem 113A and Chem 172, if you‚Äôre a biochem major if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?   But in response. Chem 172 is very easy, only 3 problem sets and a take home final. Chem 113A is known to be very difficult, but if Eric Wu is teaching you‚Äôll have a decent time. 136 is an upper Div lab and a lot of work. Don‚Äôt know anything about 156. But I would say you would be just fine since 172 doesn‚Äôt even really count as a full workload stem class. Feel free to PM if you have any other questions 156 was pretty breezy honestly if you didn‚Äôt bomb 110A.   (Biochem ‚Äò12 alum) I'm planning on doing the exact same schedule as you lol. Do note however, that Chem 136 & 144 are restricted to Chemistry + Chemistry/Materials Science majors only! I have a psychobio friend wanting to take this class despite that restriction so be sure to get in contact with the undergrad office immediately and ask about it. If you plan on taking Chem 136 this quarter, perhaps I'll see you for Chem 172 & Chem 136 & maybe Chem 113A. If you ever need any help in chem, I have shared some useful information over the chats. Please check it. I don‚Äôt mind at all! It just comes down to me liking chemistry a lot.   I also plan on going to grad school, but still haven‚Äôt decided if I will apply to biochem or pure chem programs, so the second reason is I want to be ready for both. I feel that regardless of which I choose, either way I‚Äôll be very prepared, but that could be a naive assumption.  edit: also ty for the response, your insight on each class was helpful ok that‚Äôs reassuring, I‚Äôm halfway through 110A rn and honestly I‚Äôm really enjoying it, both the concepts and the math Stop soliciting and please shut the fuck up Idk, I would definitely say both 113A and 136 are just classes you should avoid if you don‚Äôt absolutely have to take them. Just for the sake of your GPA and your overall mental health and workload. 113 isn‚Äôt even chemistry it‚Äôs more so physics. 136 is upper division NMR/organic lab. But again if Eric is teaching 113 you‚Äôll have a much easier time than what I‚Äôve heard from other profs. ok I‚Äôll keep that in mind and probably not take 136 then, since it‚Äôs not a prereq for other upper divs nor is it required for graduating (156 meanwhile I need to graduate). I‚Äôve heard about how brutal 113A can be, but I also really want to take it because I‚Äôm interested in the content, and it‚Äôs a prereq for A LOT of other upper divs I‚Äôm very interested in too. I will def check to see if Eric is teaching! If you really wanna take it , and Eric isn‚Äôt teaching; then I would say wait until another quarter when Eric is teaching cause that‚Äôs definitely when you‚Äôll have a great time! I loved that class with Eric. As for grad school I don‚Äôt even think classes are what will prepare you, but more so getting involved in research as an undergrad/ working in industry or research after you graduate. ok will definitely keep both of those things in mind. yeah I‚Äôve heard research is the biggest thing but I was also under the impression your coursework could also determine how competitive of an applicant you are (again, second to research ofc) Help!

Are you guys incredibly dense or just trying to be as obnoxious as possible? Anyone who scooters on the sidewalk deserves to crash into a wall Had a scooter almost crash into my car today Strathmore x Gayley (they were running a red light) and had a scooter almost run me over while walking across Strathmore x Charles.   I saw a scooter get a ticket today though for running a red light so yay!!! My age is starting to show, but goddamn I cannot believe how big of dipshits some ppl are out there on scooters. Running a red light going almost 30 mph without looking? What ever could go wrong? They don‚Äôt have the ability to control their scooters because they aren‚Äôt athletic lol I understand scootering *slowly* on a sidewalk when you‚Äôre on a busy road, but literally every road on campus is fairly idle and has a bike lane I saw a scooter run a red and almost get hit by a truck. Asking to die People are young and feel invincible. When you‚Äôre a kid, you‚Äôre small enough and growing quickly enough that most injuries you experience aren‚Äôt that bad and heal quickly. As you get older and bigger, your body has more momentum when you move, you‚Äôre physically further off the ground so falls have more impact, and you heal slower, but since you‚Äôve never had to deal with this before, you don‚Äôt know how to be cautious or even that you should be cautious. Well put Do math 33A and 33B fill up fast? Do math 33A and 33B normally fill up quickly?

I am looking to move into an apartment in Westwood at the start of June. Is anyone is planning to move out of their apartment (studio or 1 bedroom) at the end of the spring 2023 quarter. Preferably located in Westwood or the close surrounding areas (about a 10 minute drive to campus). looking for one more female to join a 4/4 RSU group! we‚Äôre all rising fourth years who are pretty chill with living style preferences (don‚Äôt mind guests, etc.) as long as we respect each other and keep our spaces clean! Is this still available??? :) hi i am interested :) yes! what do i do if i need to download respondus but my prof hasn‚Äôt sent a link to do so there‚Äôs a deadline for a quiz tomorrow that requires respondus but prof hasn‚Äôt given any instruction on how to download google respondus lockdown browser Maybe, like, email them instead of asking on Reddit? is it for psych 137I i mean, i was asking for someone else .. this prof had told their students to email IT instead of them psych 135 It‚Äôs the same professor so I imagine it may be the same. I started the quiz and a link to download appeared. Why is it that every class is basically around the same time next quarter? It‚Äôs basically impossible to get a complete schedule because everything is either early as hell in the morning or everything else is the exact same time as my other classes. group project so i had a group project for a course and it required us to make a presentation. a few people chose to do background research, a few chose to actually present, and i and another group member decided to actually work on the slides.   i ended up doing quite literally 99% of the work (which totaled 19 slides), and she added a mere paragraph, and copy and pasted one link. i‚Äôm so upset by this: it‚Äôs not high school anymore.  i get people have shit to do, but this class is a priority too. idk, should i tell the professor i ended up doing the majority or just leave it alone? ik we all have a common end goal of getting a good grade, but i shouldn‚Äôt have had to do everything practically all by myself.   thoughts? Honestly tell the professor if they had three weeks they had more time for just one paragraph Tell the professor. Like you said, this isnt hs anymore.   Fuck em Had something similar happen. Tell your TA. Tell the prof for sure. I told mine in a very similar situation where I literally did the entire project, and he graded me very leniently and made my teammates do an extra assignment I think that everyone works at a different speed. I have a 4.0 and at the end of my degree. I got stuck with a partner who wants everything done right then and there. I have 5 classes and I have to work at a pace/schedule. I can‚Äôt just drop everything to add some paragraphs in the middle of the night.   Did you give your partners time and space to complete their portion? Or did you power through it?  I think that group projects always end up like this and you have to take the loss. Had this happen and told the TA; got told that it didn‚Äôt matter and it was my fault for not getting her to do her part For whatever it‚Äôs worth, the professor probably already knows. Group projects are useful for the whole class, but generally not so great for the individuals in the groups. One or two people do all the work. It seems to be the nature of the beast. a. This isn‚Äôt high school anymore. Tell them and communicate that they need to put in more work BEFORE doing all of the work. They might be a last minute worker or things might‚Äôve gotten in the way. Yes, they shouldve communicate but you‚Äôre not a kid either.   b. Talk to the TAs if you believe the work their putting in isn‚Äôt enough, that should be enough action for them to pick up the slack. Since you already did the prez, talk to the TAs/professor to be graded separately if you believe their part would overall lower your/group mates grade.   c. If they simply didn‚Äôt do their part and it didn‚Äôt impact your grade, then you have to make a decision. You can take the L and talk to them for next time (and make them do more work) or tell the professor to kick him out the group/fail them for the assignment. No one will blame you if you take this option, fuck this person. Most profs dont care and will say goodluck. yeah, we had 3 weeks to get it done. i did give them time to do their part, but at the end, they never did. i did power through it because i ended up finishing the slides but like, yeah.   i get your perspective. sometimes people are extremely busy, but at the same time, this is a class you signed up for that you have a responsibility for too yknow? This is a terrible take. You can work at a different speed but you need to communicate. Can‚Äôt just assume everyone knows you‚Äôre gonna do it last minute.   - a fellow 4.0 graduate During finals week nonetheless  No where does it say they didn‚Äôt communicate.   My take/question was like did they say..‚Äùyeah I will do my part Friday‚Äù and OP powered through and got it done Wednesday.  But, hey, I might have missed something in the post. I like this one lol  it‚Äôs getting so hard because of commute time just venting  I‚Äôve been skipping classes and only going to section for 2 weeks now and even thought I‚Äôm doing pretty good in terms of grades so far I‚Äôm still worried.

Also feeling wasting so much of my time sitting in traffic. :/ this sucks No seriously idk what‚Äôs been going on but my one hour bus commute has quickly turned into a 2 hour commute no matter what route i take, it definitely has taken a toll on my body Where do you drive from I feel you. I‚Äôve been logging huge days to keep out of rush hour but sometimes it‚Äôs still crap on the 405.

How is the A√ßa√≠ Bruin Bowl from BCafe? Is it good? Found out they offer a√ßa√≠ bowls and just want to know if it‚Äôs good. It's okay, but if Salpicon is here I'd rather get their bowl instead. the BCafe one is just acai sorbet with fruits/granola Can I ask how the Salpic√≥n a√ßa√≠ bowl is different from the bcafe one? What does the Salpic√≥n one have? I just found out they Salpic√≥n offers them too lol Salpicon imo has more acai portion . I think its also a sorbet but it tastes much smoother. It comes with blueberries, strawberries, bananas, granola, and you can ask for honey or peanut butter to drizzle on top  When I got one from BCafe, it had three small scoops of sorbet and it was pretty hard from sitting in the freezer. The toppings were raspberries, diced green apple, blueberries, and like two slices of banana lol. The sorbet is also pretty sweet in my opinion, and then the apple is too sour for my taste.   &#x200B;  If its a friday and Salpicon isn't here, then the BCafe one is fine. But if you're really craving acai, then Salpicon beats them in terms of freshness, taste, and portion sizing. Hope this helps! Yes thank you so much!

I highkey do not know what I want to do with my life, I just want a stable job making hopefully 80k or more to just live in California, and school is kinda getting exhausting to the point of running away in the woods is fun. With biz-econ and DSE, I know I can maybe do analyst roles, but I was wondering what would be my chances of like data engineering/data scientist? They require a masters so I'm not too sure atm. A lot of Data Scientist roles expect grad school, but it's not unheard of to get one with only a bachelor's. With the DSE minor and your basic knowledge from CS 32, you can go after most roles in tech, but tailor your skills and resume depending on what you want (e.g. learn SQL, Spark/Hadoop, some cloud computing for Data Engineering roles). For tech roles, just keep applying - response rates are low for everyone, so it's a numbers game to get responses.  Your Biz Econ degree can be an advantage in the right domain. If you're interested in finance-related industries, it could be a leg up over applicants applying with pure quantitative degrees. Look for opportunities on the tech side of banking or consulting.

PM me if you can hold Physics 5C (will pay)  When did you first realize That all the biz and pre med clubs are actually full of shit and do nothing?? All pre-professional clubs are bullshit lmao   Being pre anything is just faking it till you make it Pre-anything club is the most useless thing. Clubs are to make friends with similar interests and sometimes for networking. Nobody cares that you were in the premed club. Especially grad schools. business is literally a professional bullshitting subject That said, the engineering groups tended to do some pretty cool stuff. I was in ASCE and that was a lot of fun. The funniest thing is when I joined a club meant for diversity and intersectionality but there was barely any intersectionality within the actual club üíÄ I think being involved with student clubs, especially as a club leader, can allow you to develop your abilities to work with with others, show that you know how to plan and execute on a goal, and demonstrate that you can maintain a lasting commitment to something you are interested in. Not every student can be fortunate enough to get into an internship or land a clinical opportunity, so pre-professional clubs can be a good way to spend your time and show that you aren't just jacking off outside of class.  Yes, any club, activity, or internship can be bullshit--whether you can speak eloquently about your experiences will determine whether they are perceived by other people as bullshit or notable and genuine. Honestly, a lot of them do teach you valuable skills tho!! I just recently had the luck to be admitted to a consulting and an investment club on campus, and am learning a lot.   I just find it ridiculous‚Äî the stingyness of the recruitment process. I feel as though everyone should be able to learn and grow, especially since UCLA has no means to actual ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù. Also, the fucking mental tax it had on me, not getting into one my freshman year, or sophomore fall. I felt worthless, and like I wasn‚Äôt going to get any success out of this school.   I hate how that‚Äôs how these clubs make you feel when they reject perfect applicants for ridiculous reasons. I had someone in one of the ‚Äúelite‚Äù consulting clubs come up to me and tell me my friend was rejected because she was a sophomore. That was it. They told me that she nailed her interview and behavioral, nothing wrong. She was just a sophomore. It‚Äôs ridiculous, the stinginess. I know I am no better, since I am in one, but it doesn‚Äôt mean I at all support this BS. I think everyone should be granted access to learn if they want to. It‚Äôs all about the connections guys.  Networking.  Fill up your contacts. Graduated from UCLA and went straight to an MD PhD program‚Ä¶. Never even considered joining one of the pre med clubs. They are useless and boring. Before i even joined one IDK, but UCLA radio is elite <3. We love the UCLA community.  Good luck on mid-terms. xoxo! Really? Even the pre med ones with clinical volunteering? If you want to learn about business then you need to listen to Andrew Tate. All 100 lessons from hustler's university are on youtube and I apply them to my co-living proptech startup What about the premed community at UCLA? Unless it‚Äôs engineering Facts though I think it‚Äôs because most engineering groups are focused on projects, which get you that hands on experience and practical skills. Bruin Racing is a great example, I know ASME and AIAA do similar stuff. I think i know what you're talking about I know someone in a similar club and someone was rejected simply bc the club president didn‚Äôt like them. Their interview was flawless Guy compensating big time Wait, we have a radio channel? Why is this downvoted You can usually get a higher proportion of of real hours by approaching doctors and finding volunteer orgs rather than doing it though a club that has a BS weekly meetings,+admin+socials( which are all fun and can help build skills) but don‚Äôt actually contribute to the real goal of building volunteer experience. This is nawt top-*gee* behaviah I sure hope you just forgot the /s at the end of the comment Including engineering for a lot of things as well Yeah, the projects are what made the engineering groups really fun. ASCE has a ton of projects like concrete canoe, steel bridge, seismic, etc that are all student run  and many of these projects welcome help from anyone who wants to join. It was nice because it was an easy way for younger and older students to hang out and work on projects together, along with just talking about classes and grouping up to work on class work together. It made my experience at UCLA feel like it was a lot more collaborative rather than competitive. Fr it's so shitty Heck yeahhh! We have so many student shows and so many playlists available!  [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Yz73i4oNiA2kxy11s5gLv](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Yz73i4oNiA2kxy11s5gLv)  <3 So true. Clubs are 90% bs and tbh the 10% of \"real work\" is far from legit. Sure, join for the 10% but notice how egotistical and self praising everyone is in the club that it's really a joke and just virtue signaling. Downvote me if you want what color is your bugatti I don't understand why I'm being downvoted. Atleast I know people aren't taking my advice because if they were then they would see the geniues of Andrew. Guess just because of the stigma surronding his name which btw he did nothing wrong. His girls who were allegdadly raped came out in support of him Enviro project 4 life ü•± U guys do recruiting for spring quarter ? Nonexistent just like yours I see where you‚Äôre coming from. The negative stigma comes from a few places. Many see his teachings as objectifying women and creating unhealthy attitudes when it comes to work, as well as other things. The fact he is in jail is a red flag, though I understand it isn‚Äôt a complete indictment of somebody‚Äôs character.   I highly recommend this [James Jani video](https://youtu.be/dmLTLkCBSN8) on hustle culture, as it may help you see some of the fault in Tate‚Äôs teachings. If, however, that means nothing to you after watching it, that‚Äôs fine. Just realize that most people see it as toxic, and most mentally healthy people you interact with will be operating with that perspective in life and in business. Heyyy,  We do, follow us on instagram for more deets or keep a look-out for student media applications that are usually out on the first weeks of the quarters.  Good luck! <3 Hey I just got done watching the video. I definitely see what you mean. When he said ‚Äúthe next big thing‚Äù and how it‚Äôs just one scroll one more everything I was like shit that‚Äôs me lol. While I don‚Äôt agree with everything in the video I‚Äôm glad to at least been challenged. I see what you mean now. Thanks for actually treating me with respect instead of going off of me - I really appreciate it and you have my respect. I hope to do the same to others, thank you‚ù§Ô∏è Super glad to hear that! I‚Äôm not about tearing people down. I think everybody is doing the best with what they have, and so it means a lot that the video meant something to you. Good luck with your business, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do great! If you live in the University Apartments (Laurel, Tipuana, Paloverde) or really anywhere, PICK UP YOUR CLOTHES FROM THE FUCKIN DRYER.

I‚Äôm currently living in a 1b single, but it gets kinda lonely and I think it would be more fun to live with 1-2 people. Any advice on where to look for roommates? I met my roommate through instagram! Some ucla unaffiliated accounts have it as like a roommate search thing where they post you and a little bio about yourself- anything really. But ya that‚Äôs how I found mine! CS32 How manageable is CS32 during the spring quarter? Planning on taking it next quarter. If you have prior programming experience, the content itself is not too difficult. The workload is somewhat heavy though, especially Projects 3 and 4 in the latter half of the quarter iirc. This question comes up a lot LOL... depends on prior programming experience, your feelings about CS31, etc etc. The class winds up usually being about the same difficulty between quarters and professors. If you have a good grasp on object oriented programming and are a relatively fast coder, it won't be too bad. If you need more time to get more familiar with C++, then of course it will take more time but the majority of people do manage. I'm taking CS32 right now. I'm a non-CS major, so I don't have much programming experience. I think the difficulty of this course is same as CS31. However, the workload is much larger, so you have to start on each project early. I‚Äôve taken CS31, and currently taking Pic 10B learning OOP and recursion and stuff. So I wanted to definitely get better at programming. Having both 31 and 10B under your belt is good. You'll be going in to that class with a bit of the knowledge and curriculum (10B overlaps). Just make sure you're careful about time management on the longer projects. Question about doing summer classes 1. are there online options or is it all in person?  2. if it is in person am I able to live through the school? 1. Yes there are online 2. Yes Check out class planner to see all summer classes offered and if they will be held online. All of the classes have that info posted now and you can already enroll. It's highly dependent on the class. Also yes, I know you are able to live at the school dorms over summer. ty Old scerri midterms Chem 14a Any have any old scerri midterms y‚Äôall can send my way he only provides 3 and I need more practiceüò´üò´üò´ Same ü•≤ he posted another one under files but theres no answer key rip There is a UCLA-run test bank at the student activities center's CPO office which may have more! 4 bd/4 ppl UA Apartment Looking for two females to form a RSU group for a 4bd/4ppl !!:) A little about us:  Rising third year ( Soc major)   -sleep around 11:30, wake up around 8:30  -like to keep shared space clean  -I‚Äôm a quiet person  - don‚Äôt mind guests   Rising second year (CS major)   -Sleep around 1 , wake up around 9   -don‚Äôt mind guests   -prefer to keep common areas clean    Preferably like to live with someone who doesn‚Äôt smokes (ok with drinking). hey i‚Äôm the other person in the group!! feel free to dm me or her if you‚Äôre interested / have any questions :) need windows usb i don't know pcs super well but mine started running super slowly to the point where it takes forever to even load webpages, i tried wiping it and it keeps giving me an error that says files are missing, does anyone have a usb with windows key on it that i can borrow? thanks! I ran into the same issue last year. It turned out my pc memory was degrading. So it‚Äôs an issue that‚Äôs just gonna get worse if you don‚Äôt replace the hardware soon. Anyways to fix the files missing thing, go to cmd and try ‚Äúsfc /scannow‚Äù. If it doesn‚Äôt work you might have to boot into bios to do a memory fix. You don‚Äôt need to pay for windows to use it, you can download a copy of windows off of the Microsoft website onto a USB and install it onto a PC.

So long story short I haven‚Äôt taken a straight up math class in like two years for various reasons I won‚Äôt get into on here. I‚Äôve done math in chemistry and physics but no calculus that I‚Äôll be dealing with in 31B. I have completely forgotten everything from math 31A and am very nervous about how tough this course is going to be. Any recommendations on how I can get through the class and what teachers would be preferable? I‚Äôm planning on taking it in the fall next academic year but if there‚Äôs a specific teacher that is a must take in a different quarter then I‚Äôll be flexible.   Thank you! Watch videos on the YouTube channel called the organic chemistry tutor for help and go to plf sessions. Hey, I'll be honest that professor Leonard on YouTube is the best for learning calculus. I recommend his lectures over any other type of resource(even ochem tutor and khan academy) his lectures are set up in a way that is similar to what most UCLA professors do. I took 31b with Robert Greene which was not a great experience, but I watched professor Leonard's lectures instead of attending Greenes class and was able to get an A. Just review some online videos and do some problems. Also skim through your textbook and your old syllabus, exams, etc. if you still have them.   Khan Academy, Organic Chem Tutor, Krista King, patrickjmt, etc. I understand your concern over math. Please check your chats once. I love professor Leonard; he just posted a video saying he's coming back to YouTube very soon as well. What was that club that sold the mochi donuts on bruinwalk and when are they coming back So delicious. we'll be back soon! we're taking donations if you're interested in supporting us and our mission :) (and so we can buy more mochi donuts LOL)   venmo: @/dayucla   instagram: @/dearasianyouthucla      thank you for supporting us! Waittttt NEED rn. slay Literally need. Dayucla >>> where are the restrooms in biomed library??? i know the one on the first floor and they‚Äôre on the maps in the stacks but i am lost Just poop in the bushes There‚Äôs the ones on the first floor, and ones in the GRR (8th stack) 4th floor btwn the main area and quiet area whoever designed the ms building/boelter is actually going to hell i hate this building with my entire being why the hell is it a god forsaken labyrinth nothing about this stupid building makes sense That building is just the backrooms I went in boelter hall and came out from a diff building entirely ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è Have you found the hidden bathroom yet? It's an engineering task to navigate the building ucla engineering entrance test: navigate boelter Considering how old the building is honestly they already might be yeah fuck boelter hall I'm sorry, you've been misinformed. This is just a never ending labyrinth and nothing more. Endless circles of fear, chasing cries of children that seem so near. Out of reach, you will never find them. This is where your story ends. my personal rankings of south campus labyrinths:  1. ms: this is where fun goes to die  2. LS building: literally looks like a set from a horror movie; there‚Äôs random warnings on the walls and occasionally you hear animal noises + the elevator is literally alcatraz core and suddenly ur in the middle of bomb shelter  3. boelter: in the shape of a hollow square so honestly not bad but the random walls and lack of staircases is pretty disorienting  4. young hall: if you‚Äôve ever taken a chem lab, you will remember the first time u took a half staircase down to another hallway to another half staircase just to realize it was outside all along  honorable/north campus mention: bunche is one of the scariest buildings i‚Äôve ever been in (at night there‚Äôs screaming üòç) That would be Phineas and Ferb It's the engineers revenge. It's a labyrinth that only the most nerdy can navigate. You must find a guide! You think they're dumb enough to be stuck in there with you?  Lol Surprise that building IS hell Young hall is worse imo, literally could not find a way to leave that building if I tried I once missed a class cause I got lost in the building ü•≤ and the other day ended up in the roof trying to get to the library üòÆ‚Äçüí® Who wants to go get lost in the backrooms of Boelter on V-Day üòç I've legit gotten lost there for 30 min when I had to pick something up from another lab lmao Ikr I hate Boelter so freaking much The first time I had a Discussion section in Boelter I missed the entire first class because I got lost for an actual hour.  A lost North Campus major wondering how I entered the building on the 5th floor. Same, this happens to me often üëÄ do tell Where is it? UCLA SEX WORK PANEL!? I need answers  Here‚Äôs an idea: don‚Äôt go if you don‚Äôt want to! what kind of answers exactly? I don‚Äôt understand why UCLA is endorsing sex work. Yes, sex workers absolutely deserve respect and rights. But the sex/porn industry not empowering, and further sexualizes women when we‚Äôre already objectified and seen as mere sex objects by society. It‚Äôs so harmful. What are they giving away? ü§® Any guys going? Why? [deleted] Stella Barey>>>>> What r they promoting this? Are they encouraging students to become sex workers? Am√©n virginity your comment and post history is public btw you literally purchase sex work on this website lmao Exactly! Shouldn't colleges be encouraging higher education (since they are literally freaking colleges) instead of turning into sex cam models? Even if it's just an information panel..... what is the point? What do students gain from this knowledge? What their options are if they choose to drop out? They are promoting this to share insights from an industry. Pretty common thing at educational institutions. sex work is work. plus, you frequent subreddits with sex work. 4+4= ATE down. Wait till you realize sex work may be more lucrative than 99% of the job prospects here Stella Barry, the ‚Äúonly fans model‚Äù is actually a ucla alum and makes around $200K a month. Idk about you, but that sounds like a pretty fucking successful Bruin to me <3 this might come as a shock to you but you can be educated AND be a sex worker!!!! it‚Äôs possible to have a degree and do sex work. It makes sense to share insights to an industry, but I have only heard of colleges showing potential career pathways to their students. That's why I am confused on why they are promoting such an event. True, but sex work has nothing to do with higher education. It makes if they have panels for doctors, teachers, and such... but I fail to see the connection here.  This is not a diss on sex workers to be clear. Omg I just realized that‚Äôs the girl on my fyp who publicly posted about wanting to sleep with her married personal trainer and got annoyed when his wife got mad. She justified her attempted homewrecking by saying she didn‚Äôt support ‚Äúforced monogamy.‚Äù Really weird person Colleges don‚Äôt just show career paths. higher education isn‚Äôt just about becoming doctors, teachers, and such. higher education is about educating yourself in general, and this event gives people a chance to educate themselves on sex work.   there‚Äôs tons of people that end up in professions that don‚Äôt correspond to a major. would you be upset if this event was about baristas? or taxi drivers? what if it were about swimming instructors? no, right? probably because those jobs aren‚Äôt stigmatized like sex work is. How to declare pre-major? I am a first-year who is currently taking Econ 11, and I'm planning on enrolling in Econ 41 for spring quarter, but it is restricted to Econ pre-majors. I'm currently admitted under \"undeclared- social science,\" but how can I declare econ as a pre-major? You need to talk to the Econ counselors and submit a Change of Major Request Form *immediately*, which you can find on the [Econ department website](https://economics.ucla.edu/undergraduate/current-students/majors-and-minors/economics). The Econ counselors are notoriously unhelpful, and you have to be declared prior to your enrollment pass. Feeling sad rn I have disability and use wheelchair.   Thought I‚Äôm already used to this.   But today when I drove my wheelchair by and saw people running around, I‚Äôm suddenly sad. I hope I can be like them. But I can‚Äôt. I know this feeling. Longing for something you can never have. It really sucks but it teaches you to not take anything for granted. And it will be rewarding for you when you have less regrets and took opportunities and chances seriously someone else overlooks and regrets later on I know what you mean. Sometimes, no matter how far I‚Äôve come and how amazing that it is for me to be where I am now with my disability‚Ä¶ sometimes it just hits me. That feeling of loss.   And even though it might be stupid or impossible or futile, it just feels cosmically unfair.    I can‚Äôt tell you that those feelings aren‚Äôt real or that they don‚Äôt suck.   You do matter though. People are glad that you‚Äôre alive. I've always been happier in life when I concentrate on what I can achieve rather than what I can't. For instance, my social anxiety is so severe that it prevents me from making new acquaintances, but I can still meet people online, which lets me maintain a modicum of a social life. Hope this helps I‚Äôm so sorry!   Why don‚Äôt you race your wheel along them? You may not be able to run, but i bet it would feel super good to feel the wind blow! I‚Äôm sorry. Sending you hugs.  Do you have a community? The group at angel city sports is phenomenal. You should check them out if you haven‚Äôt. They‚Äôre doing some amazing things. Every person I encounter is great at doing lots of things that I will never be able to do, or do well.  That's life, and it's what makes meeting new people interesting.  I don't see running as conceptually different from any other skill or hobby, like learning a new language, mastering an instrument, or even becoming good at a videogame.  Getting good at *anything* opens windows and allows you to connect with other people who have similar interests.    It's human nature to lament the loss of an option like that.  But there are *infinite* other things you could be doing.  I wouldn't waste time dwelling on it. As a former runner, always kinda thought about disability in this particular context, thanks for the perspective First thing you should realize is ain't nothing in life is fair. Some people grow up with fathers, some don't. The panda gets pampered but the pigs get slaughtered. Some people have 100% working legs, and unfortunately, you don't.  Second thing you need to realize is it ain't something you can control. I'm not religious, but there's a saying here that makes a lot of sense - God granted you¬†the serenity¬†to accept the things you cannot change, courage to change the things you can, and the wisdom to know the difference. And so with that, there's no point thinking too much about being able to run on your own two feet.  Third and last thing you need to know is your perspective is flipped. Rather than looking at others and seeing that they can run and you can't, you should see it as you can probably catch up to them thanks to the invention of the wheelchair. The gap between you and them is not as much as you think.  I'm gonna digress a little bit - as a gym goer I hope you know how much I would love a wheelchair machine with weights. It's cardio and arms all in one. Why don't we have that? Ah, but you do. Maybe this doesn't mean anything to do, but you're living with something people want too. The thing you lack works both ways. You got wheels fam some people have legs and they run places they have no clue they goin u kno ur direction innit enjoy life we alive Bro really lacking empathy I get what your saying but be fr at the end lmfao. Nobody wants to be inna wheelchair and its okay to not pretend its something good. I agree with the rest of your message tho üíÄ Competitive runners are either ruthless animals or machines I hear you. It does suck to be bound to a wheelchair. That's the reality of it. But it's not all bad. You can probably FasTrack through airport lines and amusement parks and almost always find parking. Nobody in their right mind in this era of social media is gonna throw hands at you cuz they'd be losing no matter the outcome. I'd be pretty damn bummed out too if I suddenly lost my legs and had to use a wheelchair. One of my favorite activities is playing DDR. But I wouldn't be too miserable to not still go to the gym, play Genshin, throw my dice at the dating apps on my phone, etc. I think at that point, life is still worth living and happiness is still an option. You just gotta roll with it, and I don't mean that as an insensitive pun. Life isn't about holding good cards, but rather playing bad cards well. It helps to have a sense of humor. Be that guy who yells \"Break a leg!\" as an actor gets on stage. Dress up as Brandon Stark for Halloween (if you're into that show). Every time you bump into something say \"stubbed my damn toes!\" and wink at whoever looks.  I know it's a long response, but I just want to mean well. A lot of people turn to anger and sadness and rue the world and play the victim all their lives, but that would absolutely preclude you from being a decent bro.  And bro, I'm not kidding about wishing there was a wheelchair machine in the gym. I would totally turn these skinny scientist arms into meat monsters with that shit. I'd be rolling that shit harder than girls be rolling outta my DMs, bro üòÇ What's the difference between an animal that lacks higher reasoning and a machine? Consistency, animals have bad days, machines don't. Neither is bound by morality and judgment   This is off topic *Consistency* is a complex idea to introduce as a quantifiable metric.  And some machines have more \"bad days\" than others.  A Dodge versus a Toyota, for example.  You could compare any machine to any other...  And if cars aren't universally consistent...they would have to be animals? Does Anderson Cafe Have the Mango Dragonfruit Refresher? Basically title üôÉ iirc they only have strawberry a√ßa√≠ .. Scrub Jay has the Mango Dragonfruit Refresher! Hi, im hungry and this post made me hungrier. yes Ooo ok thank you! where‚Äôs scrub jay Sorry üíÄüò≠ Oooo thanks!

Heard from a friend that a bcafe employee friend they have said Cafe 1919 is reopening next quarter and now they cleaning it out as if to prepare. It's about time. please tell me this is real and you‚Äôre not trolling all of us. i‚Äôve literally lost hope that 1919 and feast will fully reopen this year 3rd year student here. Can any 4th year+ describe the menu at 1919 and what was the best, just to get an idea what to expect and where the goalposts are? someone from ResLife told me that dining told them a few quarters back that if they were to reopen 1919, it would be a vegan place and not what it used to be rip--I really hope that's not the case though Gelato time??? üëÄ PLEASE I MISS IT Just went by 1919, the boxes that used to clutter it have been removed and lots of lights are on inside. I heard from someone they were clearing it out earlier. Have hope good sir.  Edit: I've seen folks from housing inspecting the area all day yesterday too. how good are the feast and cafe 1919? as a transfer on the hill I've been cycling through the big 3 which have been great but i'm just curious what i've been missing out on. Pizzas (100x better than the ones at the study), meatball marinara sandwiches, pizookies (cookie was freshly baked and gelato was made fresh each day), etc I graduated in 2019 and would always end up with leftover swipes; one of my fondest memories at UCLA was going to cafe 1919 around the end of every quarter and using all of them on a gigantic box of macarons üò≠ It was Italian. Sooooo good They used to have godlike paninis and gelato on friday nights, they had 2 tiramisu for 1 swipe instead of regular 1 for 1 (1919 closes on the weekends) which i would always get and i think they are the best tiramisu i‚Äôve ever had Are they gonna rename it 2019? no‚Ä¶dear God no‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs kind of crazy that only seniors can answer this question lol. and they only had 2 quarters too English Major help Hello, I am a second year English major struggling with essay writing. I just don't really know what to look for or how to analyze texts. I've just been getting by with my mediocre writing and analyzing skills. I struggle with creating a thesis and supporting it throughout an entire essay. I have all these small ideas, that are somewhat related to one another but I can't ever seem to connect these ideas in one thesis.    If any English majors are willing to send their own graded essays, preferably ones where they scored well (A, A-, B+), I would really appreciate it. No, I am not trying submit someone else's essay on for my own benefit, I am not trying to get expelled. I am just really struggling to write right now. Any advice I can get about the mental processes involved in analyzing literature would help to. Low gpa = no job? Has anyone with a low gpa applied to any jobs/ internships and had any success? What have you done to get these jobs/ internships if you don‚Äôt mind sharing?   All I have been doing is worrying over this to the point where it‚Äôs taking over my life and I‚Äôm severely depressed cause of it. My previous major screwed my gpa and although my current major gpa is high, the overall will scar my transcript forever. I‚Äôve had zero internship experience and am supposed to graduate this spring. I could really use some help/ advice please. Thank you in advance üôè It depends on what career field you‚Äôre in, but a lot of the time you can just omit GPA from your resume/application. It‚Äôs also good to remember that even if your GPA hurts job chances in the short run, in 5 years it won‚Äôt matter; when you‚Äôre far enough out of college, they stop asking. I see it more as low job = no GPA.  But if you apply to enough places you‚Äôll get a job. Just think of all the people with no degrees and good jobs Omit your overall gpa and only put down your major gpa or don‚Äôt put your gpa at all and just say you have a BA in whatever. Ur gpa doesn‚Äôt matter at all. Had many many interviews and never once has it come up or been asked about Was in an interview and they asked whats the difference between u and the next engeering student? What got me the job wasnt gpa because several people had outstanding GPA like me. What got me the job was that i was one of the few engineering students who could actually make something with my hands. That surprised them i even showed them pictures of some if my metal working. Was almost hired on the spot. Then covid. If you put down your major gpa do you have to say major gpa or something like that? Yeah, usually you would write cumulative GPA 3.5 or major GPA 3.8 or just skip it altogether. Psa the target natural / textured hair section now has been expanded to a whole aisle I just wanted to share my happy discovery this morning :D so much new stuff Best dorm to live in for returning RA I‚Äôm a returning RA, and my boss is letting me choose where I wanna stay next year. Anyone who‚Äôs been an RA, what are the best places on the hill and in the apartments to live/be an RA. Not an RA, but de neve cedar/dogwood is superrrr quiet and all the dorms are privates. Would def recommend, the RA‚Äôs dont do much at all but it works out for the good. Saxon is rly cool and u get a whole ass living room and bedroom to urself I was an RA for 3 buildings (albeit during covid). Delta. Sunset and dogwood. Of them dogwood was my favorite. The bathroom is nicer, bigger and more functional, rooms were nice and quite. You are farther from all other dorms/food but closer to campus (which was nice).   You do get a weird triangle room though and have to do rounds in Acacia which sometimes is annoying. (Acacia have squareish rooms though)  Better than delta in/out 3 buildings though. Also, occasional De Neve fires and shenanigans (if late night is still a thing, we had to help with drunk people lol)  Depending on your population, your floor can still be engaging but not overly draining. I had mostly freshman and my events had good 10peeps attending consistently.   Biggest downside (unless they changed it and/or depending on your RD) is how many fucking passives you need to do. We had to do 10 in like 2 weeks before students started moving in and de neve office is shared by 3 teams which meant no supplies and suppeeer crowded. I wasn‚Äôt an RA but hedrick summit was a really quiet dorm and our RA‚Äôs didn‚Äôt have much work to do. They spent most our budget on snacks for finals weeks and didn‚Äôt really organize many events. I think we were on the transfer student floor so it was a lot less chaotic than say the freshie dorms. ^^ Thanks! Is there anywhere on campus with access to free art supplies? (hot glue gun, markers, paint, color printer, etc.)? I'm trying to create a presentation board for an interview tmrw and it would be really convenient if there was \\^\\_\\^ in sac basement 54 (gcgp) they have a lot of colored construction paper you can take The Makers space on the hill for sure has a hot glue gun What interview is this? ü§® It was for the Bruin ambassadors program :) What's that? ü§® upper divs with no attendance anyone know of any anthro/eeb/history upper divs where attendance isnt required and lectures are recorded?

Quit as soon as fucking possible and start a new clinical position philosophy majors look here bruinwalk doesnt have much information abt this guy so thought i would ask here. has any of u taken a class with mark johnson? if so, is he a tough grader? any other notes?   im currently taking a class w him and i feel confused all the time. idk what is going on most of the time and his lectures are all over the place. can anyone relate? Crazy easy grader, and super nice. If you just talk to him during office hours about questions you have then he‚Äôll answer you pretty straightforwardly. oh wow, that makes me feel a lot better! what class did you take w him? 152 & 177 177B abt Nietzsche? Yeah any tips for reading Nietzsche?? easiest math upper divs? can anyone recommend the absolute easiest math upper divs they‚Äôve taken? at this point i‚Äôve just accepted that i chose the wrong major and am not only bad at math but also have no remaining passion for it. I‚Äôm just trying to graduate without completely tanking my gpa and feeling miserable in all my classes every quarter. i‚Äôll take anything as long as it doesn‚Äôt make me feel like i need to drop out out of college every time i go to lecture. thanks! 106 History of Math- this is super easy just take it   134 Differential Equations- Shiba (material is easy, prof is a little hard)  135 Differential Equations- Wu, J (everyone got 100 on the midterm, so easy)(don‚Äôt take it w shiba she‚Äôs really confusing and the material was literally taught at graduate level for no reason compared to Wu)   110A- Mutlu (cheat sheets permitted on midterm) math 131b 164 with Sonthalia was one of the easiest classes I‚Äôve ever taken How hard is it to get a single in a 2bd/3 person university apartment if you don‚Äôt have an RSU group?  pretty low chance those ran out fast last year.

But I am unsure if taking these classes together would be manageable. I think that if your time management is good, then you should be fine. Math 115A will probably be your hardest class, but 61 and 170E are not bad in terms of difficulty. Obviously, it‚Äôs dependent on how good the professors are and how good your math skills are, but I think it‚Äôs probably gonna be pretty doable Thank you for your advice. Has anyone done danza azteca? Hiiii! I wanna start a danza azteca club on campus, does anyone have experience with it and would be willing to help? Searching for a guy from last quarter It was last quarter when I would randomly start crying and I walked out of the sac center got stopped to sign a petition. He is Asian and taller than 5‚Äô5 (my height). He was trying to talk about his petition (it‚Äôs one that goes straight to bruin bill) but I started to cry and it was so embarrassing (bc he is cute) but I want to reach out and see if maybe someone knows him.   Back story: I was holding Starbucks from Anderson that day. I remember it was the day studs was there bc I bought earrings to make myself happy. i'm assuming you're referring to someone from CALPIRG. they're doing pledges rn so you may run across him, but if you want to take your chances, they usually gather at a table at the top of Bruinwalk/front of Kerchoff around the end/beginning of the hour to collect their pledges. I think I might know who you're talking about, but your best bet is probs coming to our table in front of Kerckoff like the other commentator said or our weekly CORE meetings for CALPIRG Waitttt did they tell you or are u a part of the club and have someone in mind? From what you said about the petition thing and bruinbill, it sounds like CALPIRG which I'm part of and the guy sounds like someone I know who's also part of it Are these Fundrager‚Äôs fun? Anyone know if these are any fun? I‚Äôm planning on going to with some friends but I never been to a ‚Äúfundrager‚Äù only been to like apartment parties. Looks cool tho. i would spend your friday anywhere else, they‚Äôre at this place called ‚Äúthe trap‚Äù and it‚Äôs somewhat fun parties but very much trashy sometimes and there‚Äôs a lot better places to be From my freshman year experience these events have lots of dudes and run out of alcohol quickly and you might have to stumble away from the police when it inevitably gets shut down but if you're already drunk when you show up it can be entertaining. If ur a guy and under 21, its the best ur gonna get at ucla tbh physics 5c prof. jiang office location????  What are the job prospect like after graduating with a degree in math of computation? I'm considering applied math, stats and math of computation.  I hope to get internship and full time job at tech field.  But I'm taking math 115a and it's really hard.  I am worried that the math classes to be conducted in the future will be very difficult.  Like algorithm, analysis, applied numerical methods. ..etc..  So I thought stats class is much easier than math ( I'm not sure) I was a financial actuarial math major w specialization in computing (that I never actually finished due to failing the last class lol) and a 2.9 GPA and got interviews at faang tech jobs and landed one at a similar Silicon Valley tech company. You‚Äôll be fine. I got a C in math 170A and D- in Math 170B lol. Also got a C in every other math upper div course I took. As and Bs in my PiC classes For a variety of reasons, I‚Äôm a fan of just doing whatever interests you most now. It only takes some basic coding knowledge to get tech jobs, you can pick it up with some practice from online resources. Any STEM degree will be enough to get a foot in the door.  That being said, if you‚Äôre not really sure what that is, math is a fantastic foundation to do whatever you want. Having a wide knowledge of math concepts + comfort with proofs prepares you really well to do anything in research / engineering in physics, chemistry, computer science, machine learning, social sciences, whatever you want. As someone who did computer science, I definitely wish I went that route myself. So of course don‚Äôt feel like you need to do it if you don‚Äôt like it, but I wouldn‚Äôt stop if the only thing holding you back is the difficulty / you‚Äôre afraid you won‚Äôt get perfect grades. i became a software engineer at a hypergrowth startup If you want to avoid taking math 115a and 131a, just switch to stats. Employment opportunities will be pretty similar, and stats is a much easier major wow how about stats and math of computation??  I'm worrying that math 115a  but I like pic..  what did you take for upper class? How did u handle 115a and131a? And what did you take for cs upper? But  i think I  have to take 115 131  finally.. even though I major in stats Yeah I got a C in math 115a. To be honest, as long as you try (which for me was doing the homework and whatever was required but I didn‚Äôt go to any lectures or discussions) professors won‚Äôt fail you, just give you a C. I think I did whatever classes were required and then since I was a FAM major a lot of my upper divs were management and econ classes. But I did algorithms I think and whatever else seemed interesting for math upper divs I honestly just studied a lot to do well in those classes since I wasn't especially talented in math -- the learning curve for your first proof based class (I'd assume) will typically be quite large since it's unlike any other math you're used to doing. The cs upper divs I took were 111, 180, and m146 115 and 131 are not required for stats. They are recommended if you want to go to grad school, but you don‚Äôt need to take them if you want to work right after undergrad I just worried about my gpa. How did you prepare midterm  I just dropped 115a after week3 and now I try to enroll in 115A again on week 5  but my midterm will be 30% and final will be 55% for grading.  do you recommend to do it again and declare math of computation?  because I hope to work or internship at sv. I see did you do internship? And can I ask through DM? yeah I see  but linear algebra is really important to stats. yes to both How does housing work during summer Can I get to stay in my current room? Or do we have to move gots to get out unless you apply for housing over the summer which is usually what some students do if they plan on taking classes but I think as long as you pay you're good. But I think(??) they may put you in a certain room, I'm not positive you'll get to keep your current room. It depends on your current dorm. Some of the dorms are closed/reserved for summer camps and there's nothing you can do. Most people will stay in rieber hall or centennial/Olympic. Last year, I was a rieber hall resident, but for the summer I was randomly assigned a room in centennial. (They had an option to choose the deluxe triple but that was the only option if I remember correctly) when the time comes, you can always reach out to housing for clarification How to choose room How do I choose my specific room and building in the housing application? I read in another post that people can do that you‚Äôll be able to during RSU, depending on the time you are assigned Room signup (RSU) hasn‚Äôt started yet. The housing application was due on the 7th, then they will process those and assign people a time to pick a room. Housing will email you after that‚Äôs done and let you how and when to signup for a particular room What is RSU Aloha Fridays menu? Anyone know what‚Äôs usually on the Aloha Fridays food truck menu? They‚Äôre at reiber today, thanks :)) Teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef, loco moco, spicy tuna Thank you!! Looking for female roommates for RSU 3 p/ 2 bd Hi, I‚Äôm looking to form an RSU group for three people. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if interested :) I‚Äôd be happy to share more about myself. laundry? using dryers?  Saw some people overloaded their dryers when I went to use the dryer. Like there were SO many clothes, like jeans boxers etc, that when I opened up that dryer some clothes just got dropped out. There was really no room.  How common is this? Do most guys put loads of clothes in one dryer instead of drying them up in separate dryers? Well, you see, the issue is that there are about eight working dryers (on a good day) for halls of thousands of kids. Most of the time, unless you do laundry super early or super late in the day, you just have to make the most out of what you get in terms of space. I fill that bitch up because any time I have ever wanted to do a second load there is someone sitting there staring me down like a hawk to secure the dryer because only 2 of them work. Same goes with washers. Yeah I am not paying for 2 dryers. I usually do two loads in two dryers because your clothes aren't going to dry if there is hella clothes in the dryer.  You want to conserve time instead of drying it twice in the same dryer. Can you try doing laundry early in the morning next time? Usually there aren‚Äôt many people doing laundry in early mornings. I mean do you put LOADS of clothes in the same dryer? Does the dryer not get overloaded? well i have loads of clothes and not loads of funds to have multiple dryers :3 ! Lmao solid rationale I‚Äôd give a pass on this Advice: PSYCH 110, 112B, 116B, EE BIOL 100 I‚Äôm currently staring at my class planner and the classes I wanted/know the professors for aren‚Äôt being offered for the spring üòî so if anyone has taken Psych 110 with Wikenheiser, Psych 112B with Trott, Psych 116B with Grisham, or EE Biol 100 with Lipman recently, would you be willing to tell me your experience please? Thanks! Some of the bruinwalk reviews are kinda out of date.. prof trott is great, i haven't taken him for 112b tho but he's a cool guy & great prof I‚Äôve taken 110 with wiken and it was great. def take him oh good! Thank you so much üò∏ Oh great thank you! do u know if the class is doable alongside two other psych upper divs and a full set of extracurriculars? üßêwould u be okay if I dmed u and asked more abt the class? When is the undie run this quarter/semester?  Least obvious USC fed It‚Äôs always Wednesday afternoon on finals week each quarter. Just to lyk it starts at 12 pm. Tomorrow night!! üòÄ The undie run is always the Wednesday night of finals week each quarter. It starts right at midnight (so technically 12:00 AM Thursday) at the corner of Strathmore and Gayley Now... we all know why you're asking. #FakeBruin help as a sophomore feeling isolated and gets rejected from everything what are some tips for finding a community here/where did you? LA can be a tough crowd.  Not a lot of people are truly open to new experiences and meeting new people.  What do you mean by ‚Äúgets rejected from everything‚Äù though?  Can you give examples?  The most important thing is to find who you are and do what you like.  You can meet people who have the same hobbies as you by doing them.  You can join groups and clubs in the school that match your interests; they will naturally bring people together with excitement over the subject matter. The best thing that helped me find a community was joining clubs with people of similar interests. Maybe see some ethnicity oriented clubs or clubs with people the same background as you. I am very introverted so this was hard for me too but I went to these clubs and tried to participate and the next thing I knew people were talking to me and I ended up leaving with numbers of friends that I made I haven‚Äôt had luck w friends from clubs in the past, so I tried applying to consulting ones, professional frats, and stuff where the group is more tight knit. I have friends, I just wish I also had more of a tight knit community too It‚Äôs kind of clich√© but I recommend reading *How to Win Friends and Influence People* by Dale Carnegie.  Work on showing interest in others, being open to their insights and experiences.  Genuine interest in others makes them open up.    I don‚Äôt mean this to say you‚Äôre doing anything wrong, but just be sure you are leaving yourself open to experiencing new relationships.  It‚Äôs tough but being confident and clear in who you are goes a long way.   Keep working at it and you‚Äôll get there.  Do you live in the dorms?  It‚Äôs such a hotbed of activity that it‚Äôs a great place to meet new people.  If you live in westwood, be friendly with your neighbors.  My best friends from college came from other kids who lived down the hall. Thank you! And yes I agree that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve found my main friend group too :) To the girl who was birding w crutches I don‚Äôt know who you are or how you did it, but I commend you nonetheless cause that was impressive asf Absolute badass energy How ‚ÄòW‚Äô affect to get my job? Im math of comp student and try to drop stat intro course(ge) Will it affect to get a job? üíÄ I‚Äôm sorry but this is kinda funny. No, a W is not the end of the world and will not be the reason you get turned away from a job. Getting jobs is more about your experience and capability to translate that into real life job experiences. Yes going to UCLA looks great but that‚Äôs the extent that it will probably get to with most employers because no one cares about your GPA in the real world. Also, I‚Äôm in a grad school on campus and was an undergraduate at UCLA as well and have Ws and NPs on my undergrad transcript and no one has ever mentioned them. It even makes you look better and more mature because you have the maturity to know when your capacity has reached its end point. So stop worrying about a W on your transcript lol Reminder that you are beautiful :) I‚Äôve recently heard so many people either talking about their body image issues or speaking about themself in a negative way and it really breaks my heart to hear :/ To whoever is reading this, please know that you are gorgeous because of your uniqueness and that you don‚Äôt need to change for anyone or anything. You belong here, you are loved, and you are beautiful <3 To call me physically beautiful feels patronizing at times because I know the reality. I know for a fact that I‚Äôm not actually ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù physically, but for some reason that doesn‚Äôt bother me. I think it‚Äôs because I know there are other far more important things in life. I have a good heart, I‚Äôm kind to people, and I set out to be my best. That‚Äôs all that really matters. We‚Äôre all going to be shriveled raisins in a couple of decades anyway ü´Çü´Çü´Ç How did you know without looking at them though?/s Tell me something I haven‚Äôt heard before Fuck no I ain‚Äôt. ‚ÄúShriveled raisins‚Äù lolol Well today sucked  Upvote 1000x Idk why but today really just sucked; it wasn‚Äôt just you i feel u. sending hugs ü´∂ Got dumped by my gf of 2 years on Monday night. Today was definitely the roughest so far. I agree ‚òùÔ∏è I feel u bro Same Everyday for me bro. But I hope you feel better. If you need anyone to talk to, hmu None of the stuff I studied for was on the midterm today haha lmao XD Actually a nice sunny day. Fresh up out the sand, February tan. ‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è Yo wth üíÄsame, today was asss and so boring I agree 100% today sucked My roommates scooter got stolen today, yep todays been pretty terrible Man got rejected? Damn brah, hittin victorian this weeeken u should join check out the pretty girls there grab drinks Has anyone done the Global Internship Program in Prague I got in but it's so expensive and idk if I want to live in the Czech Republic for 8 weeks - has anyone been and if so, how was your experience?  &#x200B;  thanks The global internship programs do tend to be pricey w/o finaid. If you can't find anyone to ask, I did mine in Berlin. idk how similar it is. Lost Cute Landyard If yall see a UCLA landyard with a stuffed yellow bear and a rainbow whale with a cat on its belly, along with a green key and 2 gold ones. Hmuüò≠ what do i do if i thought someone was cute last quarter but they‚Äôre in none of my classes now they‚Äôre in none of my classes now and i‚Äôve never even talked to him but i do see him around what should i do Approach them. You never know what will happen The pain of regret far outweighs the pain of social anxiety. Talk to him now! You should talk to him and see what happens! Ask him, ‚ÄúWere u in that (class name)? I was in that class too! You look pretty familiar.‚Äù Light up fireworks and hire one of those plane sign people telling the person u like them. Talk to them? Be casual and talk to them. you can approach with something like ‚Äòoh hey, i remember you from ‚Ä¶.. how‚Äôs it going this quarter?‚Äô L rizz Im right here just dm me lol üò≥üò≥ü•∞ü•∞ got a 52 on my exam </3 i got my midterm score back and i got a 52. i‚Äôve gotten plenty of bad scores before but this is a new low. i actually studied a lot and this was for a class that i actually need to do good in ü•≤ Was it lavelle‚Äôs class? Lmao if it makes u feel better i got a literal 40 after doing all the syllabus problems üíÄ it‚Äôll be okay, we just gotta grind through these next couple weeks and do good on the midterm and finalüí™üèΩ don‚Äôt lose hope bestie What class? Are you in AAP? Try getting into a PLF session for that class By your name, it sounds like you're a Chem major? Or at least STEM I'm guessing. Don't sweat it. Relax, and just try and use it to learn what you can do better. And maybe everyone else did poorly as well. My 153A average back in 2019 was like 55% and got curved up like crazy.  At the end of the day, it's 1 exam. And GPA really isn't /that/ important. The smartest people I know usually had at least 1 C on their transcript I swear hahah.   Take it from me, I graduated with a 4.0 MCDB, GPA really doesn't mean much at all, so don't sweat it. No one will care what your GPA was once you graduate haha I heard his exams didn‚Äôt have leave much room for mistakes :( maybe try and talk to him about how to study for his exams? Top score for math? I got 11 before it's fine OMG YES how did u know üò≠ thanks for the motivation ü´° good luck on midterm 2 and final ü´£ chem 14b ü´† Bro tryna calm op and flexing at the same time üòé Its only up from here! U got this Lmao Anyone an/ Any advice for upperclassmen students who feel more lost than when they started? Currently I am a third year physics major, would like to potentially continue studying at the graduate level in the future, but I must admit that I am not mentally up to the task considering the trajectory I would have liked to be on versus where I am at now. My major Gpa is dipping low, and I also am struggling to understand most of what I am being taught. I‚Äôm having issues commuting myself fully to my studies, and have been feeling personally lost (not sure of where I would like to go, losing my sense of self). I think I need to make some personal considerations first before really trying to worry about jobs after graduating.  If I want to end up sticking with my stem skills I think I would either a) pursuing physics or some related field of interest in graduate school or b) finding a job (which I think is more likely at the beginning) When I think of jobs that physics majors can take after graduating, software engineering, data analysis, and other engineering positions come to mind. I‚Äôm kind of am in an existential place. I am feeling very anxious and very lonely, not really sure of how I am feeling about anything. Perhaps to afraid to make mistakes. I‚Äôm wondering how people feel on the other side of the tunnel after all is said and done. Psych 120a clewett Has anyone taken psych 120a w clewett Why is there such a lack of care for commuter students It‚Äôs frustrating that ucla doesn‚Äôt realize a majority of people can‚Äôt live in LA and doesn‚Äôt  have any type of sympathy for commuter students. Yes the hub in JWC is something but there is barely any online classes and professors who don‚Äôt even take attendance can‚Äôt have a zoom option or record lectures despite covid showing that is entirely possible. I commute 60 miles one way I had to find a very willing Bruin to let me crash at their off-campus apartment just to make an 8 AM midterm tomorrow without being late. I was told the Bruin pods would be up and running for overnights two years ago. That was a lie, so. A meal plan would be nice.. like I understand staff shortages but that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt be able to access the dining halls They really should bring back the commuter meal plan more than two microwaves on the entire campus would be nice I feel like a lot of schools have a \"lack of care\" for commuter students. What bothers me as a commuter from Glendora is the lack of evening classes. Most of the classes are in the morning and overlap.   How nice would it be for afternoon/evening/Saturday classes after rush hour! I commute from San Bernardino so I totally get you, I realized it would take me 4 1/2 Hrs driving up and back so now I take the train and public transport bc it was putting way too much strain on my car. I wish the campus had more events going on during the day, I can‚Äôt even join clubs because my commute schedule won‚Äôt allow it! The fact that we have to pay to park every time we‚Äôre on campus is egregious . I‚Äôve heard they are opening up two more hubs on campus UCLA isn't an online school.  Commuter students are expected to, you know, commute.   Covid might have shown that zoom lectures are \"entirely possible\" but it also showed that they aren't very effective. One issue is if college lectures becomes fully remote it gets quite hard to justify charging hefty tuition. I feel you I commute from Ontario area and getting to school at 8 am on time for a regular class is borderline impossible let alone a midterm In this exact scenario, live over 90 miles away, have only one quarter left. Have a good friend/classmate who‚Äôs letting me crash w her. Otherwise would be totally destroyed I'd honestly be shocked if UCLA hasn't opened itself up to potential class action lawsuits over the past 4 years. They've specialized in fraud. This one Totally get you on the joining clubs I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on so many memories and new friends. How is the train and getting to/from Union station(I assume)? Always thought of doing it but never have Not to sound insensitive or anything but that‚Äôs the equivalent of saying ‚Äúpaying LA rent is egregious‚Äù Why should people who are paying rent for the dorms also subsidize your parking? I agree with this tbh. Complaining about commuting while making the choice to commute is kinda weird There are plenty of universities that offer a variety of class formats, even pre-Covid. When I tell my friends that UCLA basically only offers morning/daytime in-person classes, they‚Äôre shocked. University isn‚Äôt like high school, many students have to work or support their families. The fact that top universities like UCLA are inaccessible to so many people is pretty sad. Yikes I live near Ontario‚Ä¶..I would not want to make that commute daily‚Ä¶ I feel for you my friend! Lawsuits for what?  Did they ever sign a contract saying that the pods would be open by a certain date? The train is honestly kind of exhausting lol but SO CHEAP!!! Metrolink train to Union Station is clean, safe, and monitored. You can rest, catch up on HW, work on your laptop, eat, and they even have bathrooms in every car. It‚Äôs the best part about my commute. Taking the metro red from Union to Vermont/Sunset (sometimes Hollywood and Vine is better bc of traffic) and then the Metro 2 Orange Bus all the way to UCLA is the kicker. If there is a lot of traffic you can be delayed for up to an hour!!! (However Los Angeles is better than the IE bc the buses run literally every 10-15 mins) Definitely have to be savvy on getting around the city and prepare for the unexpected (Google Maps app will save ur life). However, it has made me grow fond of the city, helped with my social anxiety going out, and has made me more independent! Upsides: I also don‚Äôt have to pay car insurance r‚Äônow, or an insane parking permit on a campus, I don‚Äôt pay for gas, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about driving bumper to bumper on the freeway (which takes me the same amount of time that I would spend on the train lmao). My total amount for the two days I commute to campus is about $35 total. Downsides: If you wanna nap in ur car u can‚Äôt, if u want to immediately go home you have to make the whole commute home, it‚Äôs harder to stay on campus in the afternoon because while the buses in LA don‚Äôt stop running, the Metrolink trains to I.E. only run every hour and I believe the last train is at 9pm.   Sorry if that was a lot! I would def recommend you try it at least once though! Hang in there fellow commuter, just focus on your studies!! parking=/=shelter  what an egregious thought process ‚ÄúLA is egregious‚Äù Not to sound insensitive but that makes no sense . Some people don‚Äôt really have a choice lmao There are plenty of universities that offer a variety of class formats, but they tend to be second-tier institutions that are more concerned about attracting students (and money) than quality of education.  There is  a reason that top universities like UCLA don't do that.  They don't want to compromise the value of their degrees. lying to students? do you need to have signed a contract in order to commit fraud? Why don‚Äôt people have a choice Lying isn't fraud, nor is it any other crime. im pretty sure it is when it comes to your consumers Okay then, feel free to sue and see how far you get. AN N EA M130/RELIGN M132 Ancient Egyptian Religion Did anyone take this class in the fall? How is the workload/grading? Seems like an interesting subject but the Bruinwalk reviews aren‚Äôt kind. i took it, the class is a very easy A but some people still haven‚Äôt gotten their grades back from last quarter not sure if that‚Äôs a universal thing or just the way it is but yeah that‚Äôs an annoyance I took it, honestly would not recommend it at all. I got an A and I assume most students did as well, but it required reading many materials that were super convoluted and difficult‚Äî with reading journals assigned for each one. The midterm was a crazy long essay that required evidence from the sources, and the final was relatively time consuming and complicated as well. I would find a different GE if you can.

Theres usually a few true false qs (usually class design stuff), a few fill in the blanks, and a section that requires you to code something rather simple. I took that class last winter and I don‚Äôt remember any details about it at all which probably means that it wasn‚Äôt very difficult Was visiting from UCR and was greeted by Powell Cat!

If you have any other feedback about the professor or the class, that would be helpful too.  Thanks!! Liu ain‚Äôt tough, actually he‚Äôs pretty helpful, in office hours. A bit hard to keep up in lectures but your ta will help you complete homework during discussion. Don‚Äôt take Liu!!!!! Liu is pretty tough but you will definitely learn soooo much and his class is structured very well Thanks! Noted, what makes you say that though? Just curious. I appreciate the feedback ‚Äî did you have previous coding experience? I had literally 0 coding experience at all. The only ‚Äúprep‚Äù I did was read a handful of articles about what things like variables and if statements are (maybe 2 ish hours of effort before the class started) Thank you!

I got all B's last quarter and that was my first quarter here. I told my mom I got all B's and she just looked disappointed. They were High B's too like 85% - 89% but I guess she expected more cause I got all A's in HS. I just don't know man It‚Äôs okay to get C‚Äôs even. I had a perfect GPA, all A and A+  in highschool (not even one A- or below) but I‚Äôve gotten a couple C+ and a C at UCLA. Depending on your major and the classes you take, it can be almost impossible to get an A. It‚Äôs completely fine to not be perfect in college. One of my TA‚Äôs told me it‚Äôs impossible to get into med school with a GPA below a 3.7 and my friend who‚Äôs graduating from UCLA got in with a 3.2 gpa so at the end of the day it literally doesnt matter just do your best. I know some TAs who had a couple Cs and Ds in undergrad! My mom is the OG cheerleader üì£ When I got my first B, my mom said ‚ÄúWell at UCLA, a B is like an A. Great job sweetheart!‚Äù She‚Äôs my favorite. ‚ù§Ô∏è It's pretty normal to not do as well as you expect the first quarter--it's a major period of adjustment from high school into a faster and more difficult quarter system. I don't get straight A's either, and my first quarter I had some pretty bad grades on certain tests which was definitely shocking. But it's all part of the process. Your mom should remember that, yeah you're getting B's, but you're getting them at UCLA. A B isn't even bad tbh. GPA doesn't matter so much unless you're going to grad school or you're premed, but even so, I don't think all B's last quarter is going to set you back at all. B or B- is usually the average grade in most classes (at least for STEM), if that offers some perspective. High school grades are probably average A- or A if ur not going to grad school, then Cs get degrees baby. It is okay!! Depending on where you want to go for graduate school, it can actually be a plus to get a B in like Chem 14A and then get an A in Chem 14B because you can put that while you struggled, you were able to grow in the next course for a series and do better.  Not to mention you‚Äôre at UCLA. One of the most applied to and selective schools in the country. You‚Äôre at a school of valedictorians so going from straight A‚Äôs in highschool to B‚Äôs at UCLA, ESPECIALLY for your 1st quarter is not going to be incredibly detrimental. As long as you can get a few A‚Äôs in other classes and help bring up your GPA you‚Äôll be good :)   Don‚Äôt sweat it, work on building your study methods, and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help. Even if you feel like you‚Äôre the only one needing help. (Trust me you aren‚Äôt, depending on your major/courses we‚Äôre all lost) Remember that at UCLA you are competing with the best.  Everyone in your classes was probably a straight-A student in high school, or pretty close to it. Obviously not everyone will get all A's in college.   If you want to go to a very competitive graduate program, like a top-ranked medical or law school, then it might matter.  But for most UCLA students, B's are completely fine. Try to get at least some A's to boost your GPA if you can. C's get degrees It doesn‚Äôt matter tbh. You‚Äôre here to make money and have fun, not get straight A‚Äôs. Although this is coming from someone who has a hard time getting A‚Äôs because I get bored in the middle of tests.   A lot of lower div stem professors (idk ab upper div) intentionally aim for B-/B/B+ class averages so yes it‚Äôs ok  Also nothing u can do rn to change them so it is what it is  And no reason to let it get u down; as others have said it‚Äôs an adjustment period and you always have next quarter to work harder for your goal gpa (MANY more units to take.. more opportunity than u might think)  Gl! Sure. IF YOU WANT TO GO TO JAIL. Kinda all depends on your situation. If you'd like to go to a top grad school or get into med school, straight B's won't cut it. If you want to get into competitive honors societies, you're going to need above a 3.9. If your goal is to get a degree, or if you're willing to take an average job offer, passing with around a 3.0 is all you need. Think about it in a manner of in 4 years, you're going to be on the job market for your respective field. If you want the top job, you need the top resume. To get the top resume, you need honors societies/research/extracurriculurs, etc... There is something to having a high GPA in college, but it's not like you need it to get a job or to move ahead in life, it just may put you on a faster track than others.  All depends what you want and what your goals are. I think it depends on your goals! I got quite a few Bs during my engineering degree and ended up with a position in FAANG - you'll be ok! A lot of the other skills/experiences throughout college also play a large role in your next steps. The first quarter is rough - focus on better understanding your study skills and how you learn best, and you'll be ok! Cs get degrees. School is only a small portion of life for like 90% of us since we aren‚Äôt considering academia, or research for future positions. It literally will not matter because nobody is gonna ask what your gpa was 10 years down the line, they‚Äôre just gonna be like ‚Äúwow you went to ucla, that‚Äôs cool‚Äù. Depends on your future career plans.   Premed? Probably want to get those up to As.  Engineering? Hey nice job!  Gender studies? Fake post. Can‚Äôt get Bs there. no It depends on your major and what you want to do after undergraduate. Premed and prelaw definitely need perfect gpa, but other than that it really isn‚Äôt that bad. My advice as a bizecon is just search for good prof for classes cuz that‚Äôs really what decides your grade and wait for good profs unless you have to take that class rn. It‚Äôs your first quarter; its not the end of the world. You‚Äôre fine. You did the hard part which is getting into UCLA. Don‚Äôt sweat it. I know how you feel. Especially the parents approval part. If you can, start not caring about what your parents would say about your grades. You are now in the real world, I say, work hard and play hard. If that means getting a couple of Bs or Cs on your report card so be it. Don‚Äôt make the mistake if treating college like high school. You‚Äôll Ace the classes you‚Äôll have to Ace in the future and all will be fine. ENJOY the ride!! it absolutely is! i had a 3.9 GPA in high school and graduated ucla with a 3.6 and still got into grad school!! i even had a W on my transcript and B- in some of my major classes :')  i'm sorry your mom was disappointed in you -- i too have felt disappointed after getting B's, even high B's, but i can't imagine also dealing with parental pressure too. i hope she eventually lightens up -- getting a B may be upsetting, but it doesn't mean that you can't reach your goals, whatever they may be! it might make it slightly harder if your goal is to get into MIT for a CS PhD, but certainly not impossible. I also got straight Bs my first quarter and was able to pick it up after that (not that Bs are bad!!) It‚Äôs a good grade in itself, but dangerous if you want to go to grad school, especially if it‚Äôs in your major and relevant to your field. You usually can retake a class though, hopefully with a higher grade.   But let me emphasize: getting a grade of B is something to be proud of. You will thank god if you get B in some high level classes. Just work hard and enjoy. Most of the people I talk to are transfers, as I am one myself, and I haven't met a single person who wasn't in the top 5% of all of their classes in CC. My CC GPA was 4.0 with a class average over 95%, my first quarter here I got a C-, B+, and B+. While I would have liked to keep my 4.0 GPA, it just isn't the same here, you are competing for grades against people who care just as much or more than you do. I felt this. Got a C my first quarter here and it devastated me as someone who always got straight A‚Äôs throughout high school. But it also helped me realize what my strengths and weaknesses were and what to improve on. At the end of the day, a grade just tells you if you need to improve on a very specific subject and isn‚Äôt actually an indicator of what your success later on in life will look like. ? Nobody gives a shit anymore how you did in high school. Most UCLA freshmen had 4.0+ in high school.  It‚Äôs in undergrad where the diligent/smart people separate from those caught up in college social life. In graduate school, they separate the not smart but hard working from the smart ones. It‚Äôs not okay to get a B ! You need to get only A‚Äôs No. A single B and you're jobless. 'B'e real I got all Cs and Bs and school and I am doing a lot better and earning a lot more than straight A Students from my school. In fact, some of them asked me for jobs. You have to decide what kind of a student you are. If you're ok with Bs, then they're okay. If you're not okay with them, then it's not okay to get them. Depends on your diversity status. Significant numbers of underrepresented minorities get into UC med schools with sub 3.0 GPAs. If you‚Äôre not an underrepresented minority with a mediocre GPA, your gonna be at a Caribbean or osteopathy school. Thanks man this helped a bit. Idk if I wanna do pre or grad school but I still wanna keep it as an option so I'm still a bit worried Me with a 2.5 high school GPA and 4.0 UCLA GPA :0  Transfer pride lol. But for real you are right You a frat boi or sorority Lol med school [deleted] Well yes, for underrepresented minorities the average gpa for admitted med students is lower , but what makes you think this person wants to go to med school Career services used to disclose the stats  of the UCLA grads that were given offers to UCLA med (not just those who accepted). It included GPA and diversity statistics.  Go see for yourself. There'll be plenty of chances to make up ur GPA in the future so I wouldn't worry too much. Also, as a senior imo those lower div weeder classes are kinda harder than upper div ones but that could just be my major. Good luck for this quarter tho, u got this! Getting As is not the norm in college, especially here in some majors (grade deflation) Man glowed up No, I just troll my way through life and it‚Äôs fun Oh what's your major? Same tbh I'm environmental science. There's a lot of choice in which classes to take for this tho so it could be I tailored them all to be \"easier\" master list of all the business/mgmt groupme? does anyone have a link to the master list of all the business/mgmt groupme? much appreciated! :) anyone at ucla going to see boy genius , dijon , clairo on June 3rd. none of my friends listen to them and I impulsively bought a ticket. instagram is khangg_nguyen. Looking for people to go with  Why do ASUCLA restaurants ask if you‚Äôre a student or not Title, I‚Äôm curious of if this is to discount (or add more to) ASUCLA purchases, or if there‚Äôs some other purpose. And if there is, is there a website showing what percent is being applied I believe if you are a student you aren‚Äôt charged tax on food purchases ‚Äî at least that is what I have noticed on my receipts ASUCLA restaurants ask whether someone is a student or not because UCLA students get a tax-free transaction. Tbh do they ever really check if you‚Äôre a student? Bruh I gotta head back to Panda Express üëøüëø Why? Boutta keep coming back to UCLA and tell them I‚Äôm a student into my 30s Yeah, I've been asked to show my bruincard Not run by the union. I'm a student into my 30s and I find this offensive I work for ASUCLA and at orientation, they tell us to take customer's words for it.  If they're 12 and they say they're a UCLA student, we're not supposed to question it and just charge them as a UCLA student. At least that's what they told me at my orientation for the job üòÇ [deleted] 40s* It was a joke... studying for eeb 100 ecology midterm w lipman soon and im a bit lost on what to study. any tips? I dont remember much but I do remember her putting questions from the video/movie we were supposed to watch. Idk if thats still done but if thats the case, you should actually watch it unlike me. People walking out of class Did anybody else see people walking out of classes in droves today? What‚Äôs going on? Did I miss something? I mean, people have a lot of stuff to do. Sometimes don't have the availability or the desire to stay for the entire lecture. We're also exactly halfway through the quarter, so a lot of people are probably in a midway slump. sometimes class is boring asf sorry Do you need an essay or discussion done?? Call/text +1 (985) 283-7431 Which commencement ceremony to seniors usually go to? (College? Department? Both?) My family thinks I should go to both commencement ceremonies (College of Letters and Science) as well as my department's, which is quite small.   Do people usually go to both, or just one? And would I be \"missing out\" on anything by just going to my department's? I'm not sure I want to do both since one is one Friday and the other is on Sunday. I went to both. The general one you just walk in and sit. You listen to ppl talking about UCLA and how great their experience was. Kind of boring for you the audience. Then you leave but have to push yourself thru crowds of ppl waiting for the next ceremony. The dept. one you actually walk on stage and stand for about 5 seconds as they take your picture. I was first gen so my parents wanted me to go to both. I guess you don't miss out on anything per say, but this is a big accomplishment that seldom comes. Do whatever you want or whatever is convenient. I‚Äôm not going to either of mine lol You work so hard for a degree, and now you have a once in a lifetime opportunity to recognize and celebrate that accomplishment. Go to both! I didn‚Äôt go to either Yeah, I would be the first in my generation of kids to graduate so I can see that my family would be excited for that experience. I think I will leave it up to them honestly, if they really wanna go then I should let them haha.  Thanks for the input! Lol thank you for the input! I don‚Äôt know why the way you said it is cracking me up üòÇ if I had a choice, I wouldn‚Äôt be attending my ceremony either but my sisters and parents are making me Sure and congrats! Does anyone have/know how to get maps of the inside of Boelter Hall? Or maps of campus building interiors in general? I'm making a project about Boelter Hall and was hoping to get a map of some of its floors. Thanks!  Edit: I have pictures of the fire escape maps but they're not very detailed Draw yourself a square and that is essentially a per-floor map of boelter Is this team boelter from acm srs lmfao I think there are evacuation plans in the building. Also, one of any main entrances in the building can have a fire alarm annunciation panel which sometimes contains plans. Errr..... no comment UCLA Situations Insta Anyone got a request from them? They're private and also linked to Situation University on insta which is connected with other schools. I don't really like accepting random/big accounts but I'm kinda interested on what they do. Anyone following them and know what's up? they just post memes pretty much lmaoo One of the only surviving drawings of the predecessor building of Royce Hall in College of California (Oakland), from 1860.

I have some questions. (: Or perhaps just post/DM the syllabus below if you have it can't use 2 meal tickets at a time? this happened to my friend and i today we weren't able to use 2 meal tickets at the same time on campus has this happened to anyone else recently? i would do it all the time before so idk what changed Yeah I tried to do the same at veggie grill but they told me they weren't accepting multiple tickets anymore even though the system allows it. Some places like anderson cafe did take two tickets so maybe it depends on the location/whos working idk about other places but anderson now officially requires that you use only one ticket per transaction, so if u want to use 2 u have to try to split your total into separate ~$9 orders‚Ä¶ v weird (also this might not always be enforced depending on who‚Äôs working i think) Looking for people to form RSU group single pods (male) Plaza single pods Hey I'm interested! To the two loud ass girls in my lecture: why the fuck are you coming to class if you‚Äôre just going to talk the entire two hour fucking lecture. And you keep going after being shushed, like shut the fuck up. Go outside to talk you‚Äôre not paying attention either way. How can you be so selfish to think that you‚Äôre not bothering the entire lecture hall? Just shut the fuck up or skip class at that point. what class, if time permits i‚Äôll walk over one day and tell them they‚Äôre loud enough for reddit to send someone Well said. Fuck these self centered brats. Class of ‚Äò98 here.  In 1994 in my first big class ever (psych 10 with Dr Eric Holman) there was a couple that was always making out hard core in Dodd.  Each lecture.  For hours.    This reminded me of ‚Äúthings I can‚Äôt believe‚Äù. Bruh, this is always happening in most of my comm classes and I hate it. Our TA had to go tell them to stfu. I‚Äôm not super confrontational, so I don‚Äôt really know what to do but their talking (I have ADHD) doesn‚Äôt let me concentrate on the lecture, so I fixate on what they‚Äôre saying and how annoyed I am instead of the lecture. I am so happy I‚Äôm not the only one who wants to tell a b*tch off. ü§≠ this behavior was basically unheard of when I was at UCLA from 2014 to 2016, regardless of which classes I was enrolled in, inside or outside of my major. And I never saw this at community college either.  It seems this behavior became kinda common after the pandemic. Maybe people's development of a sense of etiquette was stunted by the lockdowns. idk   sorry these people are ruining the lectures for you We have to rise up and normalize looking them in the face and telling them to be quiet as a group. They can laugh off one person getting annoyed, but not if we make it clear we all want them to fuck off There were two girls in Powell today having a fullblown conversation at full volume. Some people have no self awareness. I wanted to tell them to shut up. Ong If you really want to solve the problem, tell them to shut up. Complaining to Reddit won‚Äôt help Not to mention girls with ridiculously long nails typing with their nails instead of their finger tips. Like girl, I understand you just got a fresh manicure, but I don‚Äôt gaf I swear, people have no decorum. [deleted] Ditto thank you for your award. it‚Äôs time to commence with the festivities. if OP would like to dm me classroom and time i will appear if possible I was just about to comment and ask if it was a comm class. This always happens in my comm classes. I think you just got lucky. I had classes in that timeframe where I saw this sort of behavior. Same. People NEVER talked during class when I was at a CC. I‚Äôve never had this happen and I‚Äôm a current student. Either way anecdotal evidence is not evidence enough for a noticeable change.  Idk your comment came across a bit as ‚Äòkids these days‚Äô even if you didn‚Äôt mean it to. College age students have always been capable of being assholes without a pandemic it likely won't solve the problem, but I really hope that OP and others say something. Venting to others has its uses, but it won't change anything. idk, I knew some incredibly brilliant people back in my college days and they never did this. I *almost* don't believe OP but that's because I can't even wrap my mind around such immaturity from their classmates. But I know OP has no reason to lie ig they are practicing communication üòî were they lower or upper-division? wondering if this might be more common with freshmen and sophomores ah, ok. fair enough. same here It sounds like they already have said something, given that they \"keep going after being shushed\" I saw it in a few of my upper div EE classes. Maybe people took philosophy classes a bit more seriously :) not me i was sleepy as hell half of the time because i never drank coffee and then furiously studied the night before exams and shit lol Be my Valentine I stopped by the Philosophy floor to ask a couple questions and you helped me find where my TAs office was. You are very attractive. I would have asked for your number but I did not  want to creep you out.  Please, people of reddit, help me find him.   I‚Äôm gonna check back in a couple of days to see if he‚Äôs there again , if you have any advice how to approach him please respond.üòÇ How hard is it become to approach someone and ask em for their socials? What has our world come too üíÄ Girl has no rizz you asked for it Getting rejected is not the end of the world, the worst that will happen is getting absolutely embarrassed, which is not the end of the world.   Got for it lol On godd. Mfs make things much more complicated than it needs to be Who in the Math Department thought it was a good idea to make classes 4 times a week per class :) Those who made lecture + discussion 5 times a week per class [deleted] I love whoever did that <3 way better than 2 hour lecture twice a week imo, I can‚Äôt pay attention for 2 straight hours honestly i still find it preferable to having two 75 minute lectures + one 50 minute discussion since i think it's easier to pay attention for 50 minutes instead of 75. plus it makes scheduling around those classes easier since they always start right on the hour. Lol, the math department doesn‚Äôt think. Don't forget having to take midterms in 50 minutes True having to pay attention for 2 whole hours of math would hurt my brain Genuinely don't think they exist, they're so hard to reach on top of it all. My theory is it's all operated by Powell cat behind a curtain Oh yeah that's my least favorite part! Exactly, my friend has reached out to them multiple times about their graduate application and approving a double major and it takes going in person and confronting them to get an answer. Truly ridiculous. After all i was only imaginary Recommended study spots? I‚Äôm a new grad student here and have no idea where good study spots are on campus / around campus, specifically spots that are open late in the evening! Powell Library is open 24 hours, but pretty mid. Also only parts of the library are open at night.  I see business students at Anderson pretty late into the night.  Most of the other libraries/buildings close before the evening. I guess Kerckhoff is open at night as well. boelter and biomed libraries are open til 11 mon-thurs!

Thanks! Yes I got dykstra! Cool, thank you for letting me know! When did you receive your housing offer? Do you know of other students who applied in the lottery and received a dorm offer? This morning! Is the housing offer for Spring or the next academic school year? directing mfa Hi there! Was just wondering if anyone had any insight into directing graduate program. How is it? To the broken record lady screaming outside Hedrick summit I hope you never sleep again I want to apply to UCLA for fall 2024, but there‚Äôs only a fall 2023 option bar currently; how do I apply for fall 2024?  if you‚Äôre applying for undergrad, the uc app for fall 2024 will open over the summer on august 1st! Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt lol You have negative karma on Reddit üò¢I didn‚Äôt even know that was possible but I do hope you get accepted and follow your dream. I was the least likely candidate to get into UCLA. I dropped out of high school in 10th grade. Was expelled from multiple high schools when truant officers forced me to return. I got my GED in prison. I dropped out of college twice. And I struggled severely in the community college I transferred from. But I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôm doing really good at this school. I have a 3.9 GPA. I‚Äôm in an undergraduate research program. I‚Äôm surrounded by brilliant people who inspire me every day to drag myself out of bed despite depression and continue the struggle. You can do it and if you don‚Äôt get into this particular school I‚Äôm sure there is one that is right for you. So I can start applying august 1st and won‚Äôt get a reply of admission until march, that‚Äôs about a year from now and it‚Äôs a lot of waiting. Is there like a way I could apply or at least get a reply earlier? Wow this is so inspiring! I‚Äôm so happy for you! unfortunately UCLA does not practice early admissions. expect a decision around mid march 2024 for fall.   until then, continue to work hard now to perfect your applications to the schools you apply to. this time of junior year right now is a critical time as it‚Äôs the last semester/trimester you‚Äôre in before you can officially start applying to most universities!   best of luck to everywhere you apply in the future! This is so delusional lmao Short answer is no. You just gotta wait it out. The PIQs for the UC application hardly change from year to year so if you wanted to get a head start you could work on those. Thank u! What is delusional exactly? gym buddy hey guys!! im a first year student and i really want to start hitting the gym. I have terrible form and have no idea where to start. If anyone is down to teach me a bit i would love a gym buddy!! Ofc! P.M me I gotchu. I was in the same position as u 2 years ago Subletting studio during spring quarter and summer Hi! I‚Äôm graduating this winter quarter, so I‚Äôm looking into subletting my apartment from Spring quarter (mid-March) to the end of August. My apartment is a studio on Landfair Ave. which is pretty close to UCLA. You would be rooming with another guy in the studio. I can leave furnishing within the apartment such as a bed and desk. The rent is $1002.22, excluding utilities. Please dm me if you‚Äôre interested. Thank you! Request for Supplemental Information I got an email from UCLA requesting for supplemental information. The two prompts are:  1.) In your application you may have mentioned an extraordinary talent/skill or academic achievement. This may include participation in Junior Olympics, national debate competitions, recognition for musical talent, etc. Please take this opportunity to share with us more detailed information about the level of your achievement, depth of participation, and passion for this particular area.  2.) Please describe any special circumstances that you would like us to consider that may have affected your ability to achieve academically. This may include personal circumstances, family experiences, and opportunities that were or were not available at your school or home. If you participated in an educational preparation program (i.e, EAOP, Talent Search, Upward Bound, PUENTE, etc.) please describe your level of involvement and how each program was beneficial to you.  I am a nationally ranked badminton player and compete in state, regional, and national tournaments. In my application I wrote about how I was reserved and not social but badminton and my badminton team helped me break out of my shell. How would you guys recommend going about the prompt #1 of the supplemental information without sounding redundant? Not to put more pressure, but if they are writing is because they are on the fence. So make sure to exploit whichever question you choose, build upon what you already have submitted, but also present novel information that contributes to your persona I didnt get any request. dude I‚Äôm so nervous. Chem 153A with Ellis-Guardiola? (#2) 1. Lecturing Wise 2.

Is it just lecture problems or is it also grading? Was it terrible because she‚Äôs just a bad lecturer? Or was she tough too? Thank you :) Thank u for ur response. Spring 2023 Writing II Options What are the easiest offerings for Spring 2023 Writing II? Which classes are considered to be an obtainable A? Is ENGCOMP 5W a good choice? writing ii classes fill up pretty fast. i would recommend the website [hotseat](https://hotseat.io/my-courses) which lets you know how quickly classes fill up.   as for suggestions scand50 is apparently one of the easiest classes at ucla. not sure if it‚Äôs being offered in spring but i have heard good things about it. if you can‚Äôt get 50w then 40w is also quite easy if you can get it   I have taken eng comp 3 with kipen and it was a relatively easy class. the workload is medium. i‚Äôve heard that eng comp 5w is a good choice. i have also heard that disability studies 101w is an interesting class. eng 20w is a creative writing class so you might like that if you enjoy writing stories 2023 Spring English Composition 3D Which instructor should I choose? West or Dickey? They both have good ratings.   On Bruinwalk, it says West's lecture focus on Hippop, which I know nothing of.   In your opinion, who is better? Thank you! i would say west! Experience with single dorms? So i just submitted my housing application for next year and I put a plaza single dorm at the top of my list. Does anyone know what my chances are of actually getting the single? And does anyone have any experience or know anything about life in a single dorm? Thanks! chances of getting a single dorm if you don‚Äôt have cae or other accommodations are slim to none They‚Äôre really nice! The rooms aren‚Äôt too small, lots of storage space, It‚Äôs 5 people for each bathroom at least in Hedrick and I never really have to wait to shower. I have cae!! Do you think it‚Äôs too late to apply for cae for next year‚Äôs housing then you‚Äôre more likely to fs! & probably will or at least a single dorm but just may not be a plaza nope nope! Plateia food runner employees, is the job there fun/worth it? I‚Äôll start working soon and i was wondering how it is there. Does plateia take meal ticket?

Engineer Buy a Stanford masters in engineering degree. As a recent *employed* grad with a PS & History degree (which fares even worse in employment numbers, tbh), your options are ENDLESS, especially from UCLA. What are you interested in? Think crazy broad and hone in and trust me, you can do it. Narrow down on a lab vs. corporate vs. academia and go from there. As a new grad you really should only concretely plan 1-2 years at a time with a general long term goal in mind. DM if you have questions! ThTs very weird that u cant find a job. Maybe ur not applying to right places. Where are you searching because physics degrees are very useful. Uh oh me in 6 years Stay safe I use the citizen app to stay updated.

UCLA has way more rape and sexual assault crimes compared to Berkeley, but Berkeley has sooo much more violent crime/robbery. Pick your Poisson I guess.   https://data.delmarvanow.com/crimes-on-campus/ Intersection signalling improvements at Strathmore/Gayley You may have noticed the work being done today at Strathmore/Gayley, with manual traffic control through most of the day. Now they're finished(?), and one of the improvements that was implemented is known as a [**leading pedestrian interval**](https://ladot.lacity.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/csc-policy-guidance-lpi-revised-june-2021.pdf).   Essentially, this intersection has two phases (Gayley through and Strathmore through), and pedestrians get their walk signals to go along with the corresponding car signal. [Leading pedestrian intervals give the walk signal *before* the corresponding through green starts](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop08024/images/4_12web.png) (instead there's an all red), providing safety benefits and reducing delays to pedestrians. Given the [very high volume of pedestrians](https://navigatela.lacity.org/dot/traffic_data/manual_counts/gayst206.pdf) at the intersection, this will help optimize for mobility of all and not just that of car drivers.   Next time you're crossing, pay attention to the signals and notice you have around 4 seconds to walk before the green starts. I was wondering what that was for. And this will be great, the amount of times I almost got hit by impatient drivers was unreal we should reconsider allowing cars into our campus i noticed this just now before reading the post, nice work ‚Äúproviding safety benefits and reducing delays to pedestrians.‚Äù  Do you have any data to support this?  If the pedestrian crosses at the same time they did before how does this reduce delay? Sure -  You're right, actually, that all else being equal pedestrian delays won't change. That was an error on my part (could be second order effects from fewer people turning right, but yeah that's a stretch). They may have changed the signal timing in other ways though (the shorter the Gayley through phase, the less the average ped delay is), I don't have the timing plans to check one way or another. The Highway Capacity Manual approximates pedestrian delay as (C-g)^2 /C, where C is cycle length and g is available walk time.  Safety benefits are very well-attested, though (hence why e.g. Caltrans needs to introduce LPIs whenever doing signalling work):  - https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1488&context=hc_sas_etds ped collisions -5.45% and injuries -14.7%  - https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/18044/index.cfm ped collisions -13%  - https://nacto.org/docs/usdg/safety_effectiveness_of_lpi_fayish.pdf ped collisions at least -46.2%  etc. I don't have data to back this up, and im no expert, but these are just my thoughts on the matter, and please correct me if I'm wrong:  Taking all the traffic sensors and things out of question to simplify things, and assuming the 4 seconds are added to each step of the cycle, each traffic cycle takes about 8 seconds longer, which is a delay, though a relatively small and insignificant delay in the vast majority of scenarios  Safety wise though, an all red should give turning vehicles more time to look around and spot pedestrians, as well as bikes, scooters, etc. and other vehicles, give pedestrians more time to cross (lower chance of still crossing while vehicles are trying to frantically run through a yellow light), and reduce the risk of accidents, especially in unprotected lefts. Any accident would likely cause a comparatively heavy delay, not to mention the risk of serious injury/death/etc, so I think it's probably that technicality that this is more about Upvote for the cites to research.  Applying a purely mathematic or statistical model to what is an extremely complicated system can be very problematic.  Sometimes the attempt to address numerous confounding factors ends up consuming much of your analysis (as in the CUNY paper).  Also, sometimes just a step back from scientific analysis to simple observation or common sense can render research worthless (as in the Fayish paper). >  Also, sometimes just a step back from scientific analysis to simple observation or common sense can render research worthless  Agreed, this is especially the case with transportation engineering which is much more behavioral than other fields of civil and findings can often differ significantly in magnitude (travel modelling is particularly prone to this). In the case of LPIs though the trend is pretty clear (and basically line up with what we expect from first principles), even if the size of the effect probably seems to vary significantly based on factors that may be hard to capture. Can summer courses taken at UC Davis transfer over to UCLA I want to take physics 5A over the summer but I live close to UC Davis so it would be a lot more convenient to do it there, is it possible to find an equivalent class over there and transfer the credits over to UCLA? Not 100% sure but I did take a class (equivalent of Math 32ab) at UCB during the summer a few years back since I live there and I got credit for it . The process was also super simple. The short answer is that yes, you can do this, and it's easy. You can transfer the credits; but you'll need to check with your counseling unit to make sure that the transferred credit will be recognized as fulfilling whatever requirement you want it to. thanks for letting me know!!! do you know if there's a way to check if the credits will definitely transfer though? I would hate to take a course thinking it would fulfill the req only for it to not I would email the physics department with the name of the course and description of the course you want to take at ucd. and they will give you an answer. Some times they might ask for a syllabus I sent a message to my major (biology) department through the message center on myucla is that enough? If I needed to email the physics department who would i email You use the message center on myucla. Under the send to option just time in physics and it should auto fill with the correct place. Kerckoff today What happened at Kerckoff today? I was so confused but the fire alarm went off and everyone was j staring housing for next year I'm going to be in my 4th year next year and I'm applying for university apartments. I lived in university housing during my 2nd year, but I did not live in it my third year (this year) since I was not satisfied with the housing assignment that ucla housing gave me.   I want to live in university housing next year and i would prefer to get any room in gayley heights but i've heard things about how if you didn't live in ucla housing they don't let you participate in RSU or something? can anyone clarify how it works you will be placed in the lottery!! so if there‚Äôs extra space after all returning students & incoming freshman/transfers get housing then they‚Äôll offer you a spot! U most likely will get housing, but in some cases you won‚Äôt know if you get it till like july Also they don‚Äôt really take ur preferences into account it‚Äôs randomized just as something comes up that‚Äôs available so u can get literally anything and u have no access to rsu for roommates I was going to do lottery but they waited so long to give me an offer that I just ended up signing a lease on non university housing Do you know the chances of getting housing in the lottery? like do most lottery applicants receive housing or? anyone driving or wanna carpool to eden 2/10 @ the novo? pls pm!  Psych 135 Parkinson has anyone taken this class in person? Dr. V Fuchser psych120b I‚Äôm taking Dr.Fuchser‚Äôs 120b class and noticed he‚Äôs not listed on bruinwalk for the course.   I wanted to see if anyone has taken his course before and how the felt/did? Thanks! I‚Äôm in it right now and I would say it‚Äôs not great. His lectures are VERY content heavy (80-90 slides/deck) and he tends to mumble and ramble during lecture which gets very confusing, especially considering the material is very technical. Not the worst class ever, but not one I would recommend if you have other options has anyone taken the music journalism class (music industry 144) or know anyone who has? no professor is listed on the schedule for spring 2023 so i‚Äôm curious who taught it last time and what it was like. thanks in advance! Anyone in anthro 3 know if the paper is due Tuesday or Thursday  It‚Äôs due Thursday lol Has anyone here successfully petitioned to drop below 12 units? (school of engineering) Long story short, having a rough quarter... I'm a commuter student that's completely mentally exhausted over having to drive for 1.5\\~2 hours here and back every day. I've kinda already checked out on 1 of my classes since week 3, haven't been attending or submitting assignments. Really wanted to drop this class and take it in the future because then I'd only have to come 3 days a week. Problem is that it would bring me down to 8 units and I did not know I had to petition earlier.  I was wondering if anyone in the engineering school has successfully petitioned to drop below 12 units before and the general reason you stated for dropping on your petition (if you're comfortable sharing)? Just trying to gauge what is considered a valid reason so I can have an idea on how much I can bank on my petition being approved.  My backup plan was trying to petition a late add for an asynch recorded class and then drop the other class, but idk if that's realistic this late in the quarter. I was able to for mental health issues. I got diagnosed with something and put on SSRIs. I spoke with the academic counselers online, and they were very kind and did not hesitate to approve me. I submitted my prescription as evidence and took a W on my transcript for a late drop.  If you want to drop for mental health issues, it would be safest to have a professional back you up. Your commute sounds like hell bro, I hope you're able to drop. As to your commute, have you considered public transit? Depending on where you live, it may be worth it. 2.5 hours of bus each way is better than 1.5-2 hours of car. Ah I see, nice to hear that the counselors were able to accommodate you! I'll definitely try to speak with them too. Just wondering, how long did it take for your petition to get approved? Thanks for the info! It took only a few days if I recall properly. They gave me a form to submit to my.ucla.edu. But when I met with them on video they told me right there that they'd approve me, so I already knew it was going to go through if that makes sense. Library Job Interview Advice? Ok so I got an interview for a student supervisor job at one of the libraries, which I am very excited about! However!!

Anyways this class is so damn hard for me IDK WHY but it is and I feel like I might just fail overall but am I allowed to retake core classes and will this look bad on my transcript if I want to get into a master's program? talk to your professor and see where you fall on the curve. if you‚Äôre close to failing and can‚Äôt realistically improve your grade then drop it and retake it later. it‚Äôs not an ideal situation but a W is a lot better to have on your transcript than an F. you can always write about the extenuating circumstances that led you to drop the class in the addendum of your grad school apps and admissions will take that into account. it‚Äôs not the end of the world for what class? for 100B AHHHH was it really that bad? üò≠üò≠üò≠ i have a friend who took that class too and she told me the class itself was horrible. i haven‚Äôt taken it yet but i just know it‚Äôs gonna make me want to switch out of psych Are LD Film/TV classes reserved for majors/minors only?

If you get accepted for housing accommodations, do you still pay the same for a single dorm as someone without those accommodations? I‚Äôve been planning on requesting housing accommodations as a result of my disability but I have financial hardship so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a good idea to apply depending on whether the cost is still the same. Any information is greatly appreciated!! Housing accommodations is not based on finical aid so you‚Äôll be paying the same as everyone else unless you have aid from the school or scholarship Thank you for the information! By any chance, do you have an answer for this question: If I have a UCLA scholarship, then would the scholarship cover a single dorm even if it‚Äôs above the cost of attendance? I‚Äôm not 100% sure about my answer but I think if you do have a scholarship it would depend on the base. For example if it‚Äôs an academic scholarship or etc and how you can spend the money. I would reach out to the finical aid department just to double check on it. But if you can use it then that‚Äôs great but you‚Äôd probably have to pay out of pocket for the remaining cost.  PM if u have more questions (: Is living on frat row that bad when it comes to noise and sleep? I am in the process of moving out of my 4bd 8 person apartment. I‚Äôd prefer a 2 bd 4 person but I am concerned about living on frat row cause I am an extremely light sleeper. When do the frat parties quiet down? I can deal with anything no later than 2 am on weekends. Noise levels depend on factors like if you are neighbors with a frat, which direction your unit faces etc. But living in the general vicinity there is usually one night out of the weekend where you will hear music til 2am (at the latest sometimes it will stop much earlier). Other weekends like finals, when its cold out, etc. you don't hear as much. It‚Äôs mostly pretty quiet. Thursday nights tend to have music audible till pretty late, but it depends on where your specific window faces. It‚Äôs not like frats are partying every day, or even most days. My window faces a frat and it can get pretty frustrating but honestly I get more pissed off about people with loud-ass cars and motorcycles zooming through the streets than I do about the frats because music is much more tolerable. The weekends aren't too bad, especially if you go out yourself most of the time anyways. I feel like Thursdays tend to be the worst. If you're that light of a sleeper I'd suggest some earplugs on those days. Where on frat row r u living Do you know where your prospective apartment is located in the building? If it's, for example, facing the street, on the first floor, with large windows and no soundproofing, you are gonna hear that frat music and people partying. If it's facing inwards into the apartment interior, smaller windows,  higher up, it might be better. Not worth it. If you‚Äôre a light sleeper you won‚Äôt get a wink Thursday-Sunday.

Overlapping Class Times Does anyone know if they actually stop you from enrolling if two of your lectures overlap in time? The lectures next quarter for LS107 are timed so that either way it's a bit of an issue, but I really want to take it in spring... can i lowkey just skip the lectures and self-teach/attend discussions or would that cause too much of an issue? I'd appreciate some advice if anyone has had this issue/had overlapping classes before. Thanks! They don't stop you! Do whatever is conducive to your learning.   Source: I do this all the time I‚Äôm planning to take 107 too but it looks like Pham requires attendance with the clicker questions :( I've done it a couple of quarters, but only because one of the lectures was recorded.

I was minding my own business getting work done at kerckoff when a homeless man sat down at my table directly across from me. I figured he‚Äôs no threat and minded my own business. He then proceeded to murmur and talk to himself about molesting children? (I‚Äôm assuming he suffers from schizophrenia). Then he did the unthinkable and slid his hand down his pants and partook is some seemingly ungodly motions.  The story is crazy so I thought I‚Äôd share but the bigger problem is, why isn‚Äôt there better security on campus to prohibit potentially threatening people into buildings like kerckoff. I understand it‚Äôs a public campus but shouldn‚Äôt UCLA establish greater security to ensure the safety of students? Idk food for thought.

Assignments are piling up. I keep missing class and I'm struggling to catch up with lectures. Even when I go to lecture my mind wanders. Midterms papers are piling up. This shit sucks. I'm in a terrible cycle where I can't go to sleep on time due to stress, which causes me to be sleep deprived, which makes me fall behind on work, which makes me more stressed, and so on. It's exhausting Same I contemplate ending it on the daily. Therapy doesn't help at all I feel this comments section so much. Antidepressants do really make you feel better though. Now my work isn‚Äôt getting done and I can‚Äôt get my life together, but I *feel* pretty untroubled about it üòÅ Are you possibly depressed? If so, reach out to CAPS. I feel you. Times are rough 1 adhd diagnosis from sweet amphetamines I'm with you, friend Me too.  I know some people claim it's depression but I believe it's more due to the stresses of being a student. We've been at this all of our lives and keep putting ourselves under the same pressures. We get bored, we start to procrastinate, we stop leaving the house because all the people around us are doing the same. We halt all of the novelties that are supposed to make us human, just sitting around trapped in our own heads, doing the same thing over and over. Being here really feels like we're all monkeys in cages, being instructed by other monkeys. The devastating thought is that we elected for it, for one reason or another. We've habituated to this process of day in, day out and so, if you ask me, who in their right mind would be content with this? I've been running in this hamster wheel trying to reach the horizon for far too long. We are all chasing future by selling out our present.  So, if you're like me, I don't think you're depressed. We're just bored and exhausted from this thing we've been submitting ourselves to for so long. I think about this a lot.  Best advice is to just remind yourself of the things that really give you joy and love in life, not that superficial bandaid stuff like sex and drugs but the things really make you feel free and hopeful!  Go on a hike that gives you a view of the city, go ice skating and get your skate on, play some music and let your body move the way you feel, write a song, just some ideas but anything really!  We don't have to miss out on life as we've been conditioned to think!!!  And sorry, haha, I had a lot to get off my chest cuz I'm working thru this same issue. did i write this? I‚Äôm a grad student and very much relate. I‚Äôm in therapy and take medication, yet still would like to end it all. Cocaine. Same. I gave up on therapy back in October. Life is tough. Where can I buy Girl Scout Cookies at/near UCLA? I‚Äôm tryna get some thin mints lol I saw some kids near Ackerman yesterday, but I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre there regularly Duffl store has them last time i saw on the app! I have an online link if you‚Äôd like to order that way? They were selling them on bruinwalk yesterday around 5 :) Struggling with anxiety, depression, or stress? Join a UCLA study! The Affect Treatment for Depression and Anhedonia study is designed to  examine which individuals with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and  stress are more likely to benefit from a two different versions of  therapy. Each of these therapies include components and therapeutic  strategies that have been demonstrated to be effective for these problem  areas. One therapy focuses on enhancing and increasing positive coping  and life strategies, whereas the other therapy focuses on decreasing or  eradicating negative coping and life strategies. Both versions involve  examining thoughts, modifying behaviors, and focusing on breathing.      Individuals  who seeking treatment for anxiety, depression, and stress, are eligible  for the study if they are between the ages of 18 to 65, are English  speaking, are not currently suffering from major medical conditions, and  are un-medicated.  Treatment is conducted one on one, over 15 therapy sessions over Zoom.  In-person assessments are conducted prior to beginning treatment, at 5  weeks, at 10 weeks, at completion of treatment, and at a 1 month follow  up. These assessments include diagnostic evaluations, a battery of  self-report questionnaires, behavioral observation, and physiological  recording in a laboratory.     There are no fees for any of the  assessments (prior to treatment, at 5 weeks, at 10 weeks, completion of  treatment, or follow up) or treatment. Parking costs for each assessment  are reimbursed upon request. In addition, participants are offered $75  for each assessment. To participate, follow [this link](https://uclapsych.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7ZFjbSy738Mw6IS) or email tad.study.ucla@gmail.com or call (209) 800-8930 for more information to express interest in participating. Be UCLA's guinea pig and even less felt!! what should i first pass?  definitely 23L 23L and then 14A too if you‚Äôre planning on doing the whole series 23L for sure so u can get into upper divs the following quarter I messed up for waiting until the following spring to take it ‚Äî it‚Äôs a super easy course! It shouldn‚Äôt take time away from 7C which is more demanding Second this! I first passed 23L for winter quarter when it‚Äôs the least competitive and it still filled up by the end of first pass despite having 600 spots. Spring quarter is even worse. why? Ngl I wouldn‚Äôt do first pass for 23l. I got the class second pass twice lol (dropped it later the first time). But if you really need a specific lab time then first pass. since this is your spring quarter, you are basically competing with all the other people who are following the 7 series to get a spot in 23L and 7C. also it just fills up kinda fast in my opinion and barely anyone drops got it. thanks !! RA GROUP INTERVIEW After signing up for the day/time you wanted to go for the group interview, did anyone get a confirmation email right away? I signed up but did not receive a confirmation email yet. i just received an email saying that my submission has been received and a link that shows me the day, time & location that i chose When did you submit the form? sorry poor choice of words. i didn‚Äôt just rn receive the email. i submitted it yesterday and got the second email moments later. i would email the recruitment email linked at the bottom and tell them that u just want to make sure it went through or u can try clicking the link they included and see if it shows tht way? Thank you! It‚Äôs strange it shows my form went through but I haven‚Äôt received an email yet. i wouldn‚Äôt worry about it then if it shows it went through! i didn‚Äôt get an actual email that said ‚Äúconfirmation‚Äù or anything like that, just that i submitted one. good luck on the interview:) I really appreciate you replying! Good luck on your interview as well! why is the wifi so bad? anyone else? it like disconnects twice every hour on my laptop (dell) and my iphone says full bars but doesnt even load anything? the cellular data is bad too now i have verizon wtffff Skill issue Connect to eduroam how do you connect ? Username: Username@ucla.edu Password: Your UCLA password  More steps are involved is you're on Android. bruh im trying it drops every min cool ty ! Yw :o Please respect JWC BruinHub as a space for commuters For those who don't know what BruinHub at the John Wooden is: https://citylab.ucla.edu/bruin-hub  I realize the booking system for the pods there isn't enforced at all and I have hella social anxiety, but dude, I don't wanna fucking have to come up to you and tell you to gtfo out of the pod I booked properly. I'm talking to that goober in the yellow pod right now that left his pod to yoink the one I booked. I know that one has a sour odor, but have you considered fucking off instead of inconveniencing others? I don't feel comfortable telling him to fuck off either because I feel like I'll just come off like a Karen.  Trust, I'm on the side of \"no harm done if it doesn't impact others\", but this sucks for me, I commute 65 miles and two hours or more one-way to get here. Let us commuters actually use the space made for us. Fuck, man. I have a lot of social anxiety too so I understand where you‚Äôre coming from, but you need to learn how to stick up for yourself. You‚Äôre obviously in the right in this situation and nobody‚Äôs going to judge you for being a ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù and if they do, who cares? As you said, that space was specifically made for people in your situation. Dude I'm going to be real with you. If you can't walk up to someone and ask them to leave a pod that you reserved, you won't be able to function in society. I understand that you have social anxiety, but you need to learn to control it and overcome it if you want to survive in the real world. It's fine to feel uncomfortable, and you don't have to be a social butterfly, but you need to be able to have conversations like that Bro, he probably thought that no one booked it and that it would be free for a while. Who's to say he isn't a commuter as well? I assure you that people aren't trying being rude on purpose, and no one will think you're a \"\"Karen\"\" if you just politely ask him to move. Wait are those the overnight pods?? I have been waiting for them to be active. I commute from OC with an 8 am class. One of the main skills you‚Äôre meant to learn in college is communication. So challenge yourself and politely communicate with others. Otherwise, you‚Äôre the goober in life. The Schoenberg music practice rooms are a similar situation. 80% of the day someone is using the room even though you have it reserved, even if it's a piano room and they're playing flute in it. It's completely normal and sometimes I do it too (i.e. times up but I stay or etc.), and I don't have crippling social anxiety but I'm far from the talkative to strangers type either.   Seriously, you need to learn to politely tell them to leave, it's like learning to make phone calls or order at a restaurant. These people aren't evil and nor are you a Karen for politely shooing them off. Mfw people on this sub get a world-class education. But then cant talk. May I ask where you‚Äôre commuting from? 65 miles is a lot, but I hate driving. 65 miles... why even go to this school at that point? I'll certainly advocate for myself when the stakes are higher. I just admittedly don't have high expectations for people, and stubbornly pursuing being right about something small isn't worth it for me.  I'm just exhausted mental health wise, man.  Probably not the best idea annoyed-posting in a moment of weakness, but what are ya gonna do. I realize from my wording that it comes off like I'm paralyzed by social anxiety. That's on me, I decided to talk about my mental health somewhat flippantly. I just wanna pick my battles, my guy. I appreciate the good intent, but trust, I wouldn't be in an overall better point in life if anxiety had stopped me. The site tells you whether a time slot is available or not, so it's quite clear he didn't check.  Look man, I know it's some anxiety shit but I bite the bullet where I need to when I need to get stuff done in life. Do I really have to put some entitled person's laziness ahead of my anxiety, exhaustion, and proper booking first? Sadly, I'm not sure. At least during the daytime, they're 2 hour timeslots, and I only just found out about BruinHub.  Oof, commuting from OC for an 8am? I'm sorry for your loss, I'm assuming the 5/405 is gonna be massive ass Rancho Cucamonga, or if that doesn't ring a bell, Ontario/Fontana/east of Claremont I appreciate the classism bro, can you Venmo me a couple grand to help me find an apartment in Westwood? Thank you brother frfr üôåüôå Dang ppl are bashing you but know that you're felt ü•≤ Yeah, sadly you do. Part of the transition into adulthood (which includes UCLA) is learning to advocate for yourself. Yes, social anxiety sucks, but if you think that it‚Äôs too much to politely say ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm sorry, I booked this pod from X to X,‚Äù then how are you going to handle it when a corporation overcharges you, or a restaurant gives you the wrong food?  What happens if you are hospitalized and the doctor pushes a treatment you‚Äôre uncomfortable with? These types of situations will escalate throughout your entire life, and setting and enforcing boundaries is a skill you *must* master if you want to flourish in a world that will happily run roughshod all over you to make a quick buck. All the numbers in your comment added up to 420. Congrats!        2     + 8     + 5     + 405     = 420  ^([Click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=LuckyNumber-Bot&subject=Stalk%20Me%20Pls&message=%2Fstalkme) to have me scan all your future comments.) \\ ^(Summon me on specific comments with u/LuckyNumber-Bot.) Commuter from Santa Clarita. Regardless of where you‚Äôre from the 5/405 is always ass. üò≠ It‚Äôs not fun. I take trains most of the time. Makes it even worse. Oh that does!   That‚Äôs a lot of driving. I hope that in your future you won‚Äôt need to drive so much. i mean u could always work part time and live in a cheap room at $700 Nah but I can give you a list of colleges closer to you. You know, not located in the unaffordable Westwood. And no, I won‚Äôt give you the money that I worked my ass off for. Enjoy your 2 hour commute I'm saying I'd rather choose my battles, especially given my mental health right now. There are more anxiety-inducing things for me that give far better returns than telling some idiot to get out of the pod I booked.  I realize it may not have been clear what position I am in life, but this came off unintentionally condescending, albeit probably with good intentions. Good bot Santa Clarita's near Magic Mountain, right? Forgive me going into middle-aged designated driver dad mode, but yeah, that sounds like a dogshit drive from I'm assuming the 5 South onto the 134? Is it part of choosing your battles to post resentful, passive-aggressive screeds on reddit instead of confronting people, and then lashing out at friendly advice just trying to help you? Because it seems like your mental health suffers either way, arguably worse in the case of taking to reddit. Edit: ‚Äúlashing out‚Äù was not referring to this person‚Äôs comment to me but the highest one in this comment chain with a few downvotes. why are u calling people idiots bro chill tf *Fucking felt that middle-aged dad part.*  14 to the 5, then 5 to 405 all the way to Sunset. You seem to have a chip on your shoulder about me telling you you came off unintentionally condescending while acknowledging your good intentions. If that's lashing out to you, I'm not quite sure what to tell you. Ooh, didn't know about the 14, I assume you're from the eastern part of Santa Clarita?  I see where you merge onto the 405, I guess I didn't know about that junction since most of my knowledge of that area comes from taking the 210 onto the 5 towards Castaic I was referring to your (top) comment above in this chain with -13 upvotes (and counting,) not the one you responded to me with. Sorry if that was unclear. Yeah, used to live in Castaic actually. ü§£  The bus does a circuit around SCV and it just happens to end by an entrance to the 14 on Sierra Highway. Regardless, I think perpetuating ignorant behavior through one's advice is counterproductive to me, even if said advice was well-intentioned. I think it's quite understandable that the last thing I want to be told is to cater to the offending party's speed instead of demanding that people act less foolishly.  Slightly rich of you to tell me my post was passive-aggressive as you snarkily point out the downvotes \"and counting\". I wish you the best, and I hope you get everything you need. get the fuck off ur fucking scooter on bruin walk u selfish fuck  scooter vs cane: scooter wins :(   i cannot tell you how many times i have nearly been killed by someone on a scooter. they do not yield or tell me they are coming. so annoying. please give right of way or call out or something. and as a general rule to anyone reading this please be mindful of anyone using a white cane. or else i shall whack you in the shins thank you No truer words have been spoken I've been nearly hit by a speeding scooter on the ramp 3 time and hit once in bruin plaza. How these guys continue without incurring serious injuries is beyond me. I saw a D1 swim & dive athlete completely slam into someone on Bruin walk. At least have control over your scooter üõ¥üí® [deleted] its honestly embarassing to be on scooters unless ur on the car road someone felt the need to ride a scooter inside Ackerman earlier today üò≥ The fact that they don't even stop for stop signs or lights.. its amazing someone hasn't been seriously injured yet Is it not still a dismount zone? I remember bikers and skateboarders being ticketed I also almost got hit by a scooter today. They should honestly just be banned from campus. I like to make the scooter riders sweat a little, walk into their path as they're coming, walk back, a bit of mild trolling I have to use my scooter cuz I have arthritis and it helps me with the long distances and hills at ucla, but some of y‚Äôall are insane. I‚Äôve gotten hit by other scooters while on my scooter bc so many people are careless and dont obey basic rules of the road üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæ literally saw someone on a scooter yesterday hit someone and proceed to get back on their scooter not a minute later Someone should make a device that temporarily halts birds. Would be funny to see someone fly off. South campus come through Is it okay to use them on Tiverton and Charles E Young on the east side of campus? Anywhere west of PAB and that isn‚Äôt on a road you shouldn‚Äôt ride any scooter? If it wasn‚Äôt for scooters I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay in bed for an extra 15 mins. ur mad [deleted] Imagine Bruin ride I‚Äôm sorry, my roomie had the same issue :/ Also when people just dump those heavy ass bird/lyft scooters in the middle of the walkways, it‚Äôs such a hazard for people who use mobility aids  P.S. if y‚Äôall ever see scooters that are placed in walkways or have fallen over, please try to move them if you‚Äôre able! app-based services like bird do automatically block riders on campus, but most of the scooters that still show up on bruin walk are ones students bought for personal use. those unfortunately don't have an auto-slowdown feature... this is more common than it needs to be because why did someone pass by me on their scooter.. i was inside of kerckoff.. The athletes and ppl who buy their own have privately owned scooters that don‚Äôt have the auto turn-off thing Sounds like a great way to get hit Same (I‚Äôm suicidal) good just did it to three of em and they had the audacity to look at me wrong for using a cross walk ... please hit me in the cross walk cuz ima take that check thank you sir Pretend to overact and force them to slow down, lol I was hit by a scooter and the person just left. not sure if you are talking about the same incident Caught in 4k. r/IAmVeryBadass yes especially when they are just lying around in a massive pile! And the stands are a few steps away. They still just throw the scooters around. It is beyond me why anyone would do that It's a risky game but what's life without risk Majestic Potato Tree next to Moore Hall  They're [*Kigelia africana* \"sausage trees\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigelia). The fruits are very elastic and bounce well on pavement. We had one at my high school. It was called \"the Sperm Tree\". Even school administration and teachers called it that. Sausage trees? That's even better than potato trees! Thank you for identifying it. If I get my hands on one of the fruits I'll be sure to test its bounciness üòÇ I still haven't received an RA UPDATE Is anybody in the same boat? i emailed them and i‚Äôm hoping they just goof up and we all got in ü§©ü§≠ Yea :/ Yuh Yeahüíî I got three update emails so ima just assume that one of them was supposed to say I got in and they just messed upü•≤üòÖ Okay cool keep me posted on what they say please Is this a bad thing? I JUST GOT ONE RN ABOUT AN UPDATE like right now? why did they give me an update email rn when the time to sign up already ended üò≠ yeah i will! no, I got 2 of them on the 3rd and another yesterday literally so weird, like just me tell yes or no, i don‚Äôt want an update nah fr imma take that as a yes cuz they want us so badly just got an email saying i was selected for the second selection process!üò≠ omg congrats! i finally got the rejection letter but i hope you go out there and slay awwü´§ i‚Äôll slay for the both of us! yes!!! and if you apply for a lead ra next year i‚Äôll gladly serve under you ü§≠ü§≠ LMAOO, i gotta get through this second process first but yess hopefullyüò≠ü§û AAP PC? for those of you who applied to be a PC for AAP, have y'all heard back from them by any chance? They said to expect an email with further updates by February 3rd, but I haven't received anything üòï i havent heard back either Roommate? Roomie quick facts: (she/her) - down for a private double plaza in either sunset or de neve    - i sleep at 11-1 - wake at 9-11 - i dont snore  - i will be respectful of your stuff and wont touch ur side of the room  - i clean at least once a week (usually more) - I dont do drugs (i dont vape or anything) - preferbly i dont wanna room with someone who does  - i used to drink but now i am planning on going abstinence for a while - dont mind if you drink  - i have a roomate group alr (4 other ppl- and i just need a roomie) people who work in asucla restaurants, what happens when we use expired meal tickets? Like does UCLA not pay them for the food? Or do you have to fill out extra paperwork? Or does nothing happen, you just aren't supposed to use them? i work at the taco bell at ackerman and i'll just say from personal experience that i usually just take the slip without checking anything. i remember once i actually got just an empty yellow slip of paper and still rang it up LMAO. again this is just me being a lazy employee but i know that most of my coworkers don't check if it's expired as well you cant use im pretty sure So... Do you get in trouble for taking these tickets? (And I'm aware taco bell often doesn't check, I just slipped an expired one to them earlier today that I forgot to use last Friday). Kirkoff rarely checks as well but their grilled cheese is now over $9 so I don't go there much. Carl's is 50/50, and panda and subway are almost always when it comes to checking You can... If they don't check, but I just want to make sure I'm not getting these people in trouble when I do sneak an expired one in.  Also for others reading this, do know that if you have a ticket you didn't use at an asucla store that day, you can use it (on the same night) at: 1) the dining halls, de neve I've done for sure, but epicuria and feast and b plate should work as well. 2) the take out places, ronde, b cafe, and The Study, but if doing at the Study make sure you order at the market kiosk because a human is going to need to help you  3) you can go to any of the halls and ask to exchange your ticket for a food truck ticket. So essentially if you get back to the hill and you haven't used your ticket, you can use it for dinner on the hill that same day.  Once that day is over you're pretty much screwed. You can be the butthole and sneak it in by acting natural and hoping the person doesn't check, I've done this like 3 times in the last 2 years because I don't like my swipes going to waste, but I do want to know if the cashiers get in trouble when I do this... the time i took an empty slip of paper the manager just kinda mentioned it and said \"who took this\" but i didn't get into any trouble after i said i didn't notice it in time. i'm sure the managers don't care as well because the way we do meal tickets is we wrap the receipt around the ticket and put it in a bag and at the end of the day the managers just record how many tickets were used. since TB has 3 registers and the bags are usually full by closing i doubt they check if the tickets are valid since the managers want to go home as well Yeah, not sure if this comes off as rude or not but it seems like OP has never worked a minimum wage/ food service job before  I‚Äôve worked two, and I can tell you that the vast majority of employees don‚Äôt care at all since they‚Äôre hourly.   Even managers, unless it‚Äôs something like in n out where their management are trying to make it their career I have. 1 in food service, 1 right now as a valet. But my food service (subway) the owner taught me the meaning of anxiety. I literally didn't want to go to work in the chance that she was in. She'd just sit at the till berating us to go faster (you are making custom sandwiches, you can only go so fast). Even some of the customers would get concerned at times. That or the reviews were written by ex co workers who were petty... I do know that turnover rate was hecking rapid, our \"manager\" (made 25¬¢ more than us) was there for 8 months, and in that time, staff had pretty much fully been replaced like 4 times... so ya. When she wasn't in she'd spy on us with work cams, which isn't bad in itself but she'd call in and complain if it was really slow and we didn't have anything to do because we'd done it already. If the till was wrong (even if she was the one managing it) the difference would come out of our paycheck, she'd sometimes not pay us fully either so we had to track our own hours. Not a fun experience. And at closing, we couldn't close early, but we also had to be out 10 min after closing, and honestly, it took like 30 min to get everything put away and final round of cleaning. She would call us if she noticed we were taking long, but like there's 20 things to do for closing, so idk what you want lady. The job itself wasn't hard though, she was just scary. And honestly that soup like never got changed, and we'd just stick new date stickers on the veggies to make it seem like they were prepped today Incase food inspector came by. I'd report her for bad practices but she closed down during Covid. Still traumatized from the experience though. :') so anyway this is where I come from with the concern while asking this question. I'm glad UCLA got good management  Edit: added some more stuff that was left in the crevices of my memory wtf does the sky say  You made us cry. I think. ‚ÄúYou made us cry. Stream Grammys on paramount.‚Äù I missed the first part as well All I see is cry at the end Saw lizzo, bitch, oclock I‚Äôm so confused One of the messages was \"...Beyonce, you made music history...\" ‚ÄúYou made us cry‚Äù  Idk where people are seeing ‚ÄúLizzo‚Äù lol https://www.instagram.com/stories/alionachurina/3032704133743654155/ When I was real little, the skywriters actually had to fly in the shape of the letters, and they stayed around so much longer. They probably used some horrible toxic chemicals instead of what they have now, which seems to start to dissipate after 10 seconds, so I can never read the whole message It looks like it says ‚Äúadhd, you made us cry‚Äù Looks like some viral/guerilla marketing stunt. I usually ignore it I thought it said ‚ÄúLizzo it‚Äôs Bad, bxtch oclock‚Äù That bitch annoyingüòÇüòÇ that makes more sense, I thought bad said end üò≠ Be Careful üòÆ  Damn bro Man, and I hadn't seen one of these for a while Anyone know anything about what‚Äôs being set up next to the theater? Is this event happening tonight?  It's the red carpet for the premiere of Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania does anyone know if they limit how many people can stand on the outside? i feel like it‚Äôs going to be more packed than usual today I figured as much, just surprised they‚Äôre doing it so early. Idk anything about premiers though. Isn‚Äôt the movie releasing in theaters on the 17th? The movie's official release date is February 17th. A movie premiere is an advanced screening for the cast, filmmakers, press, critics, special guests, etc. to generate media coverage. taking my last lower div to declare cogsci major hi! i'm taking my last lower div rn to declare my cogsci major and will be declaring after this quarter. can i still first pass upper divs that restricts their first passes only to declared majors (like psych 120a)? or am i still considered a pre major and cannot first pass them even though i'll be done w lower divs this quarter? Rende west portions are bad Recently I noticed the portion size for rende west has reduced significantly. I am getting half as much as I used to compared to last quarter. I know yesterday the lady scooped me 1/2 a scoop of beans and half a scoop of rice. Like what‚Äôs up with that I feel like it depends on which worker is there at the time. The other day I got a fat ass bowl and was so satisfied just to go two days later and get a half scoop of rice and beans w/ legitimately 6 chips. Yup, I‚Äôve been taking pictures of the portions since last year and they very clearly have decreased significantly no update for ra/ara group interview status lol i applied but never got an update email (checked spam and everything) saying that I did/didn't get picked for a group interview   know the deadline was at noon so should I just assume that I didn't get it or is it time to (\"politely\") harass reslife i'm in the same boat as you unfortunately :D ! i definitely feel like you should call reslife if they can help you. even if you didn‚Äôt move on, you still deserve to know I‚Äôm in the same position. I tried to call reslife but the person I talked to didn‚Äôt even know they had extended/shifted the process and thought interviews started today. She said to just email the recruitment email and ask if they‚Äôve finished sending them out me too‚Ä¶ where‚Äôd you hear about the noon deadline? check your spam! mine ended up in my spam and was sent Friday but I didn't see it until today Same here yall we smile through the pain üòò did you hear back? the noon deadline was in the email that people who were offered a group interview were sent. more specifically it was saying that the deadline to pick a slot for the group interview was today at noon cat food if anyone has any extra cat food for kittens, or cat food (wet and/or dry) to donate please msg me! AirPods found by Franz Hall Message or comment if they are urs:))) Do,K or Robichaux, C.E. for Math 61? Who and why? I would go w/ Do, his exams are a little harder but he‚Äôs a lot more generous about grades (and nicer in general imo). Also just my opinion but Robichaux comes off w/ a ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù attitude. On every assignment, exam, etc she always sends an announcement saying don‚Äôt ask for extension, don‚Äôt ask for curve etc. Like I understand if you want to let students know your policy that‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not necessary to send out a message every week about it and constantly mention it every lecture.   Although if you don‚Äôt go to class or really prefer being able to rewatch lectures then go w/ Robichaux. Do doesn‚Äôt record his lectures, and also was hesitant to release lecture notes for some reason until tons of people requested it. I am taking 61 with Do right now and his exams are basically reworded questions from the weekly quizzes and the HW. He is a nice prof but his lectures don't feel too necessary. It kind of feels like he is just copying from his notes and that I could learn well enough by self-studying from the textbook. I personally loved Prof Do!!! He‚Äôs a really nice guy and a good lecturer. The material in 61 generally isn‚Äôt too hard so I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a bad choice. I did have him for 115A however so I can‚Äôt really speak on how he teaches 61 specifically. As someone whose worked with both they are nice  people but Robichaux background fits better for math 61 than Do. I don‚Äôt think either are bad choices I had Robichaux for 61 and have Do for 32B rn and tbh, Robichaux is better. The tests are pretty much the same difficulty, but Robichaux's lectures are way better than Do's. Prof. Do is super dry, you'll need a few percs to get through his lectures. His exams and hw are also on the harder side, but as long as you do the hw you should be okay. For us he didn't record lecture or post notes till halfway through, not sure about now. I took math 61 with Robichaux and I fucking died Do assigns a lottt of hw (15-25 questions per week) but his exams are fair and are really similar to hw and quizzes. I‚Äôd take him again, but his class ends up being a lot of active graded effort. I have Do rn, he‚Äôs quite nice and I like going to his lectures. His homeworks and exams are also good, mostly easy questions and then a few challenging ones that help you understand the material. So far the workload is very manageable and I think he explains things well. Robichaux is a little rough with the tests. She also teaches straight from the textbook so you could just read the textbook instead of attending lectures.  Also could be that I hate proof math‚Ä¶ maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe‚Ä¶ Robichaux is a no brainer choice for me. Robichaux doesn‚Äôt necessarily always record her lectures, it might just depend on the room she gets. She is not recording lectures for Math 180 this quarter. Omg I totally agree about the \"fuck off\" attitude thingy. At first I was enrolled in Vicaria's section but I switched to Robichaux's just for the recordings. That was a grave mistake. I think I would have had a much better time if I had just stuck with Vicaria. Yeah it would have been annoying to not be able to rewatch lectures but ultimately it would have saved my GPA and my mental and physical health. Wait till you see the \"fuck off\" attitude of DO when he said he couldn't do anything but fail you at the end of the course. Robichaux is much nicer, approachable and clearer in terms of grading/ passing people. Exactly. I feel like reading the textbook is much better than taking his course. I had him for 115a as well and thought he was great. Partially agree. He literally just gave loads of definitions and trivial examples every class. ah shit, what did she do? Okay, You failed or you passed in the end?   DO failed me in his 115A class. Some homework is like 30 pages!!! Just my experience, in taking both of them. In my class w/ Do final average was 82 (which is insanely high for an upper div math class) and he still lowered final grade cutoffs. Robichaux‚Äôs final avg was like 72 or smth and she gave practically no adjustment towards grade cutoffs/curve. Of course your experience may differ. Yeah he just spammed lemmas and definitions without actually explaining them üíÄ I don't feel comfortable putting the details of my situation out in the open so I'll PM you I passed but my GPA took a significant hit. good for you Parking Spot for Spring Break hey!  anyone have a parking spot that they‚Äôd be able to lend to me from around 2 pm on march 25th to \\~april 1st, with no street sweeping? willing to pay!  thank you i have one! pm me glenrock bunk beds does glenrock (not glenrock west) have bunk beds according to the floorplan maps on the website it looks like they have them but I'm not sure Antman and the Wasp I am a HUGE fan of Marvel and it's my dream to go to the movie premiere so please if anyone has any means for me to go, I would appreciate you forever!

Looking to do some networking on LinkedIn and was hoping I could get premium for free through UCLA You can get 6 months of free LinkedIn Premium as a college student. Just search for it online and register yourself as a UCLA student. what does linkedin premium offer Bplate Breakfast üòã Eggs and ham with a side of salmonella To all cc transfers, what did you do to get into UCLA? I‚Äôm asking about your stats, and specifically your extracurriculars. I‚Äôm trying to go as an applied math major transfer.   Any response would be great! accepted as a global studies transfer  gpa: 3.78  extracurriculars: not a single one, but i did write about how i travel often and how traveling has inspired me to major in gs Started a business, 2k hours volunteering, worked multiple jobs (shift lead at one of them), private tutor, peer mentoring, free tutoring for low income students, started a recycling program at a parents workplace.   I‚Äôm a pure math major. My cc gpa was 3.73 when I applied, 3.81 when I submit updated grades for spring semester. I plan to transfer 2024/2025 to ucla or usc from community college! what are your top schools? Stats: 4.0   Extracurriculars: I wrote that I self-studied japanese and mentioned some of the programming stuff I had done on my own time (not a lot, nothing impressive.)  got in for Math of Computation pm me and I can give you a list! MechE @ UCLA from CC. 3.82 GPA + lots of work experience. I understand that my GPA was on the lower-end of most transfers, at least in Engineering at UCLA. Best of luck. accepted major: poli sci applied to: UCR, UCLA, UCSD, USC accepted schools: all gpa: 3.89 transferred from: Santa Monica College extracurriculars: NONE, I graduated from high school in 2020 and had to work straight outta high school and throughout the pandemic to provide for myself My advice is to completely fill up your extra curriculars portion of the application and mention how you want to continue that activity at university. Like ‚ÄúI was on the dance team all throughout high school, and stuck with my passion for dance by joining my community colleges ballet company. I would like to continue to stay involved in ballet by joining the ballet company at ~x~ school‚Äù etc etc LA, Berkeley, Davis, SD, what do yall do when internship starts before school ends? I'm in the interview process with a company located in Boston, and the start date for all interns is June 5th(non-flexible), which is before the spring quarter ends.  I know because ucs end school later than other schools, many internships conflict with our school schedule.  How should I go about solving this type of problem? Pretty much the same thing happened to me last year so I asked if I could work remotely for the first week. They understood my situation and were pretty flexible with me working fewer hours to take my finals. It was a little rough getting through finals week and I missed out on getting to know ppl at the beginning but it worked out in the end. Ask your professors if they can accomodate first. IF they say no then you start a week later. just tell them you‚Äôre starting a little later Most internships are pretty flexible. Let them know ucla is on the quarter system and, if they‚Äôre a good employer, they should either let you work remotely (with a reduced workload) for the first few weeks or just push back your start date.

How can I check Satisfactory Academic Progress?  I am a first year and was wondering if anyone knew how to check the Satisfactory Academic Progress Standard? Is that on DARS or who can I contact?    I want to make sure I am doing well and want to know how many units I should‚Äôve completed for my first year here. Thanks!   (PS: if it turns out I don‚Äôt meet the academic progress standards, I can still make the units up during this summer right? I heard it can be done at a community college and not just ucla?) It's typically 45 units per year for satisfactory progress.  Check with an advisor in your department about which specific classes. ethnomusicology 30 groupme? or any tips for the midterm is appreciated i dont think there‚Äôs a groupme üò≠ but i also have no idea how to study for the midterm cops and firemen every weekend when someone sets a fire alarm off  CEE 110 with Lopez Droguett Has anybody taken cee 110 with Droguett? How's the workload? it's very light in my opinion, I enjoyed the class Very standard, not super tough, I did find his lecture delivery to be a bit‚Ä¶ flat? EEB 120 Does anyone actually feel like they know what's going on in the class? I feel super lost and confused lol no i also didn‚Äôt even study for the midterm I literally have no idea what‚Äôs going on +1 she talks too fast and isn't clear with explanations. If you don't sit and read the book for 100 hrs in a 24 hr day you have to depend on ur 7b knowledge and if u took 7b a while ago as a transfer then ur screwed. I've never felt so lost during a midterm and I thought I studied enough. Looking for roommates! (F) Hi, I‚Äôm a rising senior MIMG major looking for roommates for UA. I usually sleep between 12-1am, wake up 8-9am, don‚Äôt smoke/drink (prefer to live with those who do not also). I like to keep my space relatively clean and maintain a quiet environment. Please DM me if you want to talk further!  Would love to do roommate activities like game/movie night, exploring LA, hiking, going to the beach, etc‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¢I‚Äôm open to groups of 4,5 or 6 roommates total/if you already have a group I could join that works also.  ‚Ä¢If you‚Äôre in stem or pre-med that would be a plus :) Hey! My DM isn‚Äôt working rn for some reason but I‚Äôd love to talk more! I‚Äôll try to DM later haha Just DM‚Äôd you! Aethiests & spiritual people read this  I had an extremely vivid dream where I gained access to the ‚Äúreal bible‚Äù and it explained that the world and universe we are currently living in is a version of ‚Äúhell.‚Äù I am an atheist so I don‚Äôt believe in heaven or hell but to my understanding, the concept of hell is eternal suffering. And when you think about it, it makes sense. On this earth, everyone labels it as ‚Äúa fucked up world‚Äù and all we see is constant suffering around the world. Mass shootings, homicide, war, violence, and systems created for the wrong reasons. And why are we as human beings capable of thinking, planning, and committing such atrocious acts? Why do we go to wars where so many innocents are murdered. And why are there so many fucked government systems are made to oppress people, overwork them, and prevent them from achieving a stress-free, happy life. Why does one person have enough to feed the whole world yet another doesnt have enough to feed themselves? This is all so fucked up and I question why we aren‚Äôt perfect beings who truly spread love, kindness, and never have dark intrusive thoughts. and yes I understand that theres a few actual and real responses to this but on a spiritual topic, wouldn‚Äôt it make sense that this life is a version of hell? sure just don‚Äôt start a podcast about it I‚Äôve thought about similar things before. It might be like ‚ÄúThe Good Place.‚Äù   Also most people think that heaven, hell, and whatever in between are in separate locations without really thinking about how it can all be at the same place. Life on earth can be heaven or hell too. Not very Panglossian of you Atheist discovers the problem of evil Hell is just a moral construct, average humans live better today than most of our species' history   There are very few moments in history when things are less fucked up than today Genshin Impact lore because in hell you cant bust nuts ‚ÄúDream‚Äù  Also if you‚Äôre really curious take a biological anthropology course Yo man I had a similar dream and in it I controlled what happens around me and I made all the suffering worse so obviously I am the ruler of this purgatory. You sound cool tho so let's make a deal: point me at a soul you don't like and feed me bank notes and I'll drop the Sun on them with a snap of my fingers. Don't worry about them, souls don't get sent to shadow realms when they're already in the shadow realm. Just don't back out of our little deal and you're golden Yup. They need to Read genesis they just sting What‚Äôs the alarm that‚Äôs going off near/on the hill?

Comment if you‚Äôd be interested ‚ò∫Ô∏è How To Experience Ant Man Premiere I randomly saw that Ant-Man‚Äôs premiere is in Westwood tomorrow. I tried to find information for the in person event, but only found links for a livestream. Is there anything there to do for fans to just walk up and see? Or is this essentially a closed off event? Damn am I still gonna be able to get to Falafel Inc? Most likely closed off event, but usually they allow fans to stand around curbside (near Diddy Reese) in a bit of an odd situation‚Äîregarding UCLA supplemental request i have been working on and wrapping up my responses to the UCLA supplemental request, but have been debating whether or not i should fill out the second prompt (educational opportunities, etc.)   i attend a rigorous high-school ranked highly in the nation, but all of our courses are labeled ‚Äúcollege prep.‚Äù on the UC application, there wasn‚Äôt a selection for college prep so I just put down ‚Äúno honors‚Äù instead. we also don‚Äôt offer AP-designated courses, so I added a blurb in the additional info section about how I self-studied the AP tests I listed. but for the second prompt, i was wondering if it‚Äôs bad to further elaborate that my school is extremely rigorous and that a lack of APs is only due to our odd curriculum? i feel that it might be unnecessary or even inconsiderate to write about that, but people have also told me to not leave any of the prompts blank.  for now, i just have my response as a short statement on how i went about self-studying the AP courses. one thing about the UCs is that they don‚Äôt accept official transcripts when applying, which sucks because my transcript has all the details about our curriculum (including an AP explanation) on it. my grades are also fine (one B, rest As through senior year), so i don‚Äôt think i have to explain them.   i was wondering if any students had advice to share regarding this situation. thank y‚Äôall for reading this‚Äîi‚Äôm just hella stressed as the deadline to submit the supplemental is tmrw Definitely elaborate about your school‚Äôs unique curriculum and how you self-studied for the AP exams - AOs love to see initiative! For reference, my school didn‚Äôt really offer AP courses either so I put that in the additional information section to explain my situation. Tell them about your specific situation! It's not your fault that the school doesn't offer AP courses; self-studying demonstrates that you went above and beyond the expectations of your environment. No need to worry about being \"inconsiderate,\" the readers have to go through 150k applications so nothing is really personal at this scale :P.  Good luck! Tell them. That‚Äôs what they are asking for is for you to fill in some blanks. They are looking for a reason to keep you. Also, your school should have a profile that was sent to UCLA, so now tell them what you did to make sure you are going to be successful despite what you may have not had. i think you should tell them! i‚Äôve heard that admissions officers know what‚Äôs offered/not offered at specific schools but i wouldn‚Äôt bank my chances on that, esp if you think it‚Äôs important to your app ahhh appreciate this so much! i‚Äôll keep my response then‚Äîhoping for the best!! haircut place nearby for non-straight hair basically title   need a haircut pretty badly. Does anyone with curlier hair have recommendations for spots near ucla to get it done at? I don‚Äôt trust places for shit üò≠ Parvaneh salon in the salon suites by Trader Joe‚Äôs specializes in curly hair cuts. She did my roommate‚Äôs, and she absolutely loves it Why do people put their backpacks in the only lockers that lock but don‚Äôt actually lock them Genuine question. I‚Äôm too 1 IQ to remember my own lock combination and scared of locking in my backpack. Plus, I trust that no one will steal my backpack (not like I got anything good in it anyways). I haven‚Äôt had it stolen yet. Some lockers r broken and the rest are occupied Personally I just turn the knob up without scrambling the numbers so that potential thieves would probably still skip it and I don‚Äôt have to remember a combination i haven‚Äôt learned how to use the lockers and i don‚Äôt wanna lock my stuff in while learningüòÖ Just take their stuff out since they don't mind the risk of it being stolen anyway. /s How Gurl you are a ucla student you can figure out how to use a locker üò≠ Real without the /s lmaoo well when you put it like thatüò≠ anyone dislike their roommates? I am going through a hard time currently with my roommate situation. is anyone else going through the same problem rn? it‚Äôs really hard to stay motivated in such a negative environment. For me it‚Äôs more just feeling awkward and clumsy around them‚Ä¶and being watched makes me even MORE clumsy First and third one yes. Eventually went with a single studio for senior year. I had to move out of my UA because it was so bad so yes buying lunch swipe tomorrow at Deneve. Thx!  Bruh you need to find yourself a dedicated swipe dealer. The \"thx\" is back! Hi!! Dm me i live at de neve :)) How much Best and worst things about living off-campus? I have heard most people say that they prefer University Apartments over dorms.  I currently live in the dorms and I‚Äôve had good and bad experiences in them.  If you live in the UA, why do you like to live in them and how many roommates would you recommend? Thank you! if you‚Äôre someone who doesn‚Äôt cook (and be 100% real with yourself ) you‚Äôre gonna shrivel up and die if you don‚Äôt have a meal plan ‚Äî i didnt have any meal plan or money so i was constantly hungry , and tbh it can be very time consuming for some to make meals for themselves three times a day looking for roommates hi! 2 rising senior girls looking for roommates next year! we are looking into university apartments, preferably 4ppl/2 bedrooms.   a little about us: we are both introverts, bio majors, and chill people. our interests include video games, anime, and music !  we sleep around 12am and would prefer quiet and clean people. pls dm us if ur interested!! My DM isn‚Äôt working for some reason but I‚Äôm interested! I‚Äôll try to DM later what‚Äôs a good ipad model for notetaking/school in general? trying to look for those that are most worth it cost wise üò≠ i don‚Äôt want to break the bank Just get the cheaper base model with an Apple Pencil, if you‚Äôre just taking notes anything else is overkill i think the ipad air is just as good as the pro if not like an inch smaller. better price too. i would have gotten it if it came out when I needed one. also try and get the 2nd gen apple pencil, the first is kinda a pain to charge I would just get the base model and honestly I bought both an Apple Pencil and a stylus from Amazon and there wasn‚Äôt a huge difference so I would just get a stylus from Amazon The answer is: The largest screen size you can get at the cheapest price you can possibly find. To me, that means the 12.9 inch iPad Pro with the minimum storage, no cellular, and the oldest model you can find (2018 being as far back as they go). Best Buy open box deals tend to be as good as you can reliably expect to find for basically-new ones, at around like $750 for the lowest open-box. Otherwise, there‚Äôs used.  The big screen is honestly the most significant feature; it‚Äôs almost the exact size of an 8.5x11 piece of paper and so it feels very natural to write on. The smaller screens always feel somehow‚Ä¶ restrictive.   The other key feature is the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil. The double tap to change writing tool feature and the  magnetic attachment/charging are reeeeally nice and significantly improve the usability over any other stylus you can possibly use for writing on any iPad.  The only truly mandatory aftermarket thing to buy for it is a matte screen protector. It improves the writing experience sooooo much. Not just in creating a subtle resistance, but in the fact that it makes your palm stick to the screen way less. I recommend paperlike if you have money, or supershieldz matte screen protectors on Amazon if you want the best bang-for-your-buck (though it‚Äôs hard to apply them perfectly without practice).   As for the case, you do need something, but I recommend the lightest and least-floppy case you can get. If you want to get a keyboard case, I like the Apple folio keyboard case over the Apple Magic Keyboard case. If you don‚Äôt want that or don‚Äôt have the money, my real life hack recommendation is to get a super cheap magnetically-attaching folio case off of Amazon, and then *cut off* the part that fold over the front or folds up to make a stand. My reasoning: heavy cases that try to grip around the edges of the iPad never stay on properly and can‚Äôt truly protect it if you drop it. They only make it noticeably heavier, harder to hold on to, and more likely for you to drop it. The only way to truly protect it is to not drop it, like a computer. By the same token, floppy parts that fold over the screen don‚Äôt really serve any protective purpose, especially if you have the matte screen protector, and they just make it harder to hold the iPad. They also generally aren‚Äôt good as stands because the magnets are too weak to trust all the time, and 98% of the time all you want to do is lay it flat and write on it like a magic piece of paper anyway (unless you‚Äôre going to use it in a way where you should really be considering the keyboard folio anyway) so you just need something to make a simple, flat barrier between the iPad‚Äôs back and the surface you‚Äôre laying it on. I have the iPad Air and I love it but the iPad Pro is another good option if you have the money for it. Also target sometimes has deals for iPads so check that out + there‚Äôs a student discount that target gives. You just have to register for it at targetstudent or something like that Get the air. The pro is overkill. roommates for university apartments hi! i'm looking for girls to room with next year in the university apartments, probably in a 2 bed/4 person or a 4 bed/8 person, but open to other options. i'm a second year now, and i'm neat and have a pretty normal sleep schedule. lmk if you're interested! DM me- I‚Äôm interested. Anyone going to the premiere tomorrow? I don't know whats a good time to head over there, but I do want to see Paul Rudd lol what time does it begin? Online, it says that it starts at 5pm I'm not sure, probably in the night around 7 maybe? thank you! do people go to volleyball open gyms at wooden?  yes, a lot of people go. you can find higher level volleyball on monday, wednesday, Sunday nights and more beginner friendly volleyball on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.   if you ever come around to the nightly open gyms, come say hi to me (my name is Erik!!!) Coughing The amount of people I see coughing without covering their mouth. Especially inside. I want to strangle you. Even just coughing in general. It‚Äôs so obnoxious. Especially wet coughs. Ew. Shut up. I hope you know I‚Äôm judging you. Especially when they have them crunchy ass coughs üò¶ yeah tbh if you‚Äôre sick and still coming to class the least you can do is wear a mask People who do this always cough the ways kids do. Just wide mouths, in people‚Äôs faces with such ignorance right behind you in lecture hall üò£ i get that people can‚Äôt control it‚Ä¶ the thing I don‚Äôt understand is when a lecture is recorded or made available online through Zoom, and someone who is nonstop coughing, no mask, decides to come to lecture anyways‚Ä¶. like maybe at that point you should take the online option. the rest of us don‚Äôt want to get sick from you üò≠ Preach Sometimes I cough but I wear my mask everywhere so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Love this. Worked out at Wooden the other day and some girl was coughing all over the place. Didn‚Äôt wipe down after either. You‚Äôd think we‚Äôd be better than this I can't help it, I have asthma and my inhaler can only do so much Lmao this is why I hate being sick üò≠ I do cover my mouth though cuss like wtf Ive identified every super spreader in my classes and avoid them like the plague bc they ARE the plague. Follow these three methods to cover your cough, as directed by the CDC:  1. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue. After you‚Äôve used it, place it in a wastebasket. 2. If you don‚Äôt have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve or into your elbow to prevent the spread of particles. Do not sneeze or cough into your hands! 3. If you are suffering from a cough or bout of sneezing, wearing a mask is an excellent way to also protect the spread of germs. Being reviled by coughing in general is such a shit take. Do you want people to choke on their coughs or something? You cant control when you cough though‚Ä¶  UCLA needs to bring back sick trays so sick people can stay in their dorms You‚Äôre obnoxious lol, you lost me at ‚Äúcoughing in general‚Äù like people can ALWAYS control it Ah yes, the weekly \"why don't people cover their cough and/or wear a mask?\" post  Edit: fwiw I'm not taking a pro-cough, anti-mask, spread-your-phlegm-far-and-wide stance lol. I've just noticed a ridiculous number of what amounts to the same exact post. Even when I‚Äôm just clearing my throat from a delightful meal I will try to cover my mouth. You‚Äôve never coughed before? First time? Kids can be taught to cover their mouths. These are adults that don't care. ugh, I felt the ick just thinking about it ‚Äúcoughing without covering their mouth‚Äù giving out sick trays wont make people stay in their dorms. ppl are still going to non-mandatory recorded lectures i dont think dorm food is gonna stop them ‚Äúeven just coughing in general‚Äù  edit: i agree that not covering mouth is gross. however, coughing is a natural thing and to be disgusted by it is stupid I was pretty sick at the weekend (wore a mask, covered my face, used hand sanitiser etc.) and was really pissed I had to go to the dining for breakfast and risk getting others sick cause there was no takeout places for breakfast my roomies could pick up for me. A sick tray would have avoided that. Sure people who go to lectures despite being sick aren‚Äôt going to take notice of them but not even giving them as an option for the people who do want to be conscientious?  OP is right about people not covering their mouths being gross but being mad at people for coughing in the first place? Nah, asshole territory. fair enough ask a friend/roommate to take ur card and get u takeout? they never check the photo. there are def solutions to your problem üôè I did, they got me takeout at lunch and dinner when it was possible. It‚Äôs not possible at breakfast on the weekends when there is no takeout options.  Also my roommates shouldn‚Äôt have to be inconvenienced by me being ill, you‚Äôre essentially suggesting a roommate sick tray service which UCLA could provide. First your argument is people wont uptake it so they wont even seek a workaround like asking their roommates and now you‚Äôre suggesting I find a workaround that is the same as a sick tray just inconveniences another student not the meal services team that are being paid (albiet not enough).

Reasons you prefer a University-owned apartment over dorms? Why do some people prefer a university-owned apartment over dorms?  Also, can you tell me about your experiences in university-owned apartments and what ratio of bedrooms to occupants you would recommend? Thanks! i‚Äôve lived in a classic triple, deluxe triple, and now i live in the new 4b/8p university apartments.    pros of dorms: more opportunities to interact with different people if that‚Äôs what you prefer. floor lounges + shared bathrooms make you see people other than your roommates more often. if you don‚Äôt like cooking, the meal plan is great. some buildings have great locations, like sproul cove and landing. if you‚Äôre not someone who requires a lot of space or owns a lot of things, a good option   cons of dorms: RAs. UAs technically have RAs but more out of formality than anything. you get to do your own thing and they would never really know. no kitchen, no bathroom of your own. you‚Äôre stuck eating what you have on the hill, or doordashing/walking out to westwood if you want something else which is a price on top of your meal plan. dorms tend to be louder at night, at least in my experience.   pros of UAs: for the price, they‚Äôre good apartments. utilities are included in cost so that‚Äôs not an extra thing to worry about, and everyone having their own bruinbill means you dont have to nag someone to pay their rent. if something breaks in a UA vs a standard apartment, it‚Äôs easier to get something fixed through ucla work orders than a landlord. i enjoy cooking, so that‚Äôs a big plus over dorms. i also like having non-shared bathrooms so between a deluxe triple private bath and a UA, a UA seemed better. no housing people to check you into the building past a certain time or RAs roaming the building, so if you perchance partake in certain things under a certain legal age you won‚Äôt get written up or anything. much closer to westwood for food or groceries, and there‚Äôs a bus stop near each apartment that takes you to campus (it‚Äôs a similar distance by walk from the dorms anyways)   cons of UA: more things to clean. your own bathroom and kitchen are nice but your apartment will be in charge of keeping them tidy. bad roommate situations are exasperated because there are more responsibilities and more opportunities for things to go wrong. if all bathrooms are occupied and you really gotta take a shit or piss you can‚Äôt just go up or down a floor like at the dorms if all the stalls are taken (hasn‚Äôt happened to me yet but is a possibility)   our 4b/8p apartment has managed to stay really clean but that‚Äôs essentially a miracle. it‚Äôs hard to get a triple to coordinate things, let alone 8 people. the new buildings are nice and new though and are in a good location, so i would recommend the 4b/4p apartments at laurel/tipuana/palo verde I had a UA studio all to myself. That alone was worth it after years of bad roommate luck. Could have my girlfriend sleep over anytime without having to ask the roommate, could go to sleep anytime without roommate doing weird things like blasting k-pop at random hours or snoring, don't have to wait to use the restroom,etc. Can actually cook. Had more space. Plus it was all billed, covered by scholarship, and reasonably priced. Although I did miss the super fast download speeds of the dorm internet, talking to neighbors on the floor, and greater ease of dining options, getting a good night's sleep and freedom was too much to pass up.

Do y'all know if I can send flowers to the dorms and what the process is like for that? They are perishable so I wasn't sure. Yes you can. It will be placed in the mailing center, and the recipient has to pick it up from there. They‚Äôll get an email about a package addressed to them. id say make sure the company you are ordering them from have a good shipping system in place and they last the time it takes to ship i used a grocery delivery system. i am just rlly praying the person knows where /howto drop the stuff off. i put in the instructions to leave  it at the mail carry place but idk if they will know what that is. maybe call the front desk of the person's dorm building? and see if they can make an exception of accepting the flowers and calling your someone to pick it up. or contact their roommate and see if the deliverer can give it to them instead? Senior-year grades Hello! When you applied to UCLA, did you have to send your senior-year grades as well? Thanks! Yeah you have to do like a mid year and end of year transcript (don't get rescinded).

Physics 1A (Kusenko), CS 33, Math 32B ‚Ä¶ i think physics and cs is the move. I remember math 32B had plenty of open seats because no one wants to take that shit. tbf depends on the professors tho Hauser vs Corbin for 1B Leaning towards Hauser. Heard good and bad things about Corbin. I am interested in Physics and am doing really well in 1A if that's a factor.  Edit: I understand that Corbin is difficult, but Bruinwalk shows that Hauser gave out \\~15% As and Corbin gave out near 50% for 1B Isn't Corbin the guy that gives midterms with a 20% average The default graph displayed for Corbin 1B is spring 2020, the first quarter immediately following the start of the pandemic when no one really knew what was happening. When you compare Corbin on a regular year they're a lot similar in A grade distributions. i had corbin and i think he was the only professor ive had where i was focused enough to not switch off of my notes app during class. i found his class to be actually really enjoyable because he would really make you think and actually have to use some problem-solving. Everyone whines about Corbin‚Äôs test scores being super low, but if you really care about learning physics I would strongly recommend taking him. Yeah you might get a couple bad quiz scores, but his difficulty will really push you to understand the content in a much deeper way than the other professors do Hauser is an amazing professor. Very enjoyable lectures and fair exams. Don‚Äôt take Corbin how was his grade distribution? It's not too difficult to get an A. Balanceable? Stats 101A and Math 31B at the same time? Is this doable with some free-time? what‚Äôs one ucla dining food option that you never get tired of i feel like i could eat a study sandwich every day for the rest of my time here and not get sick of it I am alum now, but I literally did eat 2 study sandwiches a day during my sophomore year for 2 straight quarters and did not even once want for something else Bplate olive oil mocha bread -not sure if they still have that The one thing I miss about UCLA.

Bucket list thing. Thanks :) Red carpet premieres usually require you to be invited by someone in the cast or crew, or be in the media. In the past, when I noticed them setting up for a premier, I would walk up to someone working (I tried to find someone with a clipboard and walkie talkie) and simply ask, \"will there be any seats available for the public?\" I'd say there was about a 50% chance they'd say yes. Instructions were usually to return at a certain time and wait in line. Movies that I got into were generally the lesser well known ones, but they were always fun and you would spot a celebrity. Not sure how to score a ticket, but here is the [schedule](https://thewestwoodvillage.com/events/movie-premieres/).  There is one tomorrow and another one on 2/22. There's a website called gofobo screenings where you can sign up to attend movie premieres - and they send you email alerts for future premieres or screenings as well The time I did it, I noticed a long line in front of the theater and just waited. Usually there are announcements about these things but I'm not sure if there's any central location which lists all the premiers. Related to this, the new antman movie appears to be premiering in Westwood today. Does anyone know the time? It‚Äôs a private event so the time isn‚Äôt published. Only other way to attend premieres is if they have a fan red carpet events where stars will sometimes take pictures and autographs with fans.

Best, cheap places in Westwood to get blackheads removed for men?  a bathroom with a mirror Famously, male blackheads are more difficult to remove than female blackheads Salicylic acid twice a week A dermatologist‚Äôs office As an esthi it depends on how bad it is. So SMC does have facials for the lower end and the students there are really good for extractions. I would avoid the biore strips and try an aha/bha exfoliater. Try bliss jelly glow peel 2x a week after ur cleanser. Cerave cleanser with salicylic acid. Get a moisturizer gel or water based depends on skin type. They have one with Hyaluronic acid from ELF. Then a sunscreen like Black girl sunscreen. Remember 35+ face, 50+ on body. Look dm me directly and we can figure out something for your skin type. I‚Äôll do it for $5 better off asking on r/skincare For fast and cheap results you can honestly just get a blackhead remover nose strip from target or a facial exfoliator scrub for a few bucks and see an instant slight change. To manage them though I recommend a salicylic acid face wash or serum and go from there. Or you can maybe get a derm referral through UC SHIP, could be expensive though, it depends. buy one of those wax/gel patches and remove them yourself man Go to a derm or use acids. Strips will fuck your skin up. Dont do them But avoid the strips cause they're really drying for the pores. Consider my suggestions if you'd like. They're all affordable and you can get them from target or some at the ucla store. Also we can talk more about ur lifestyle habits that might contribute to it. Just try the diore strips before going somewhere? Worked 100% for me.

Thanks dude, pm ur skin details and I'll help. It depends on what‚Äôs causing them, but generally you need a combination of some exfoliation and more moisturizer. A retinol cream on top of that, and you should have super smooth skin with small pores.  Be consistent, and if you aren‚Äôt using a little bit of some kind of moisturizer with some SPF in it every morning, definitely start there. but pre med Looking for fourth roommate for UA (F) hi! we're 3 rising juniors looking for one more person for a 4P/2R UA!   \\- We would like to keep a clean living space   please pm if interested :) EEB 143 has anyone taken 143 with Knowles before? there‚Äôs no reviews on bruinwalk :( He is an incredibly chill professor, super easy course load and he tends to change the schedule and assignments to best fit the needs of the students!

Tons of people work in jobs that are unrelated to their undergrad majors. By having a bachelors degree, you‚Äôve demonstrated that you know how to learn, and how to learn a lot quickly.

Schedule:  \\- Physics 4AL (Arisaka)  \\- Physics 1B (Hausser)  \\- CS 111 (Eggert)  \\- Math 115A (Shinko)  111 I know all about. I don't know anything about upper-div maths and have heard 1B is harder than 1A and 4AL is a substantial amount of work. [removed] how is 115a? it‚Äôs subjective because I know people who found it very easy while I‚Äôm struggling. The concepts covered are easy to understand, i just find proof writing to be hard How is upper division math compared to lower div?  Upper div and lower div classes are quite different. I feel like lower div classes are all about ingraining ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how you do xyz‚Äù and the homework/exams are often ‚Äúsolve ___‚Äù and the way to do well in those classes is just doing a bunch of practice problems. Upper div classes are largely ‚Äúhere‚Äôs why you did xyz that you did in lower div.‚Äù So upper div classes are largely proof based and the homework and exams will reflect that, with many problems being ‚Äúshow ___‚Äù or ‚Äúprove ___.‚Äù Difficulty is subjective because some people pick up proof logic quickly and others don‚Äôt. I personally found some upper div classes harder than some lower divs, but there are also easy upper divs (170E/S for instance) that are easier than harder lower divs (like 32A/B) 115A kicking my ass no cap Only upper div I took in math was 115a, but if that is representative of the rest then the main difference is it‚Äôs much more proof based. Very valuable skill to have by the way, as someone who went into research I definitely wish I had learned a more solid foundation of math knowledge and proofs. depends on which class you need to take. 131A/B may just be the hardest class (or one of the hardest)  in all of undergrad period. (I‚Äôm math of comp and am almost graduated after taking some pretty hard cs classes too idt they compare lol) Second this, also math of comp. 131B kicking my ass Anyone able to tell me about the following math professors? For Math 115A:  \\- Richard Wong  \\- Forte Shinko Really liked Wong (had him for 32B). He was nice & tests were fair. Plus he has a rlly relaxing voice I really liked Wong for 32A. His tests were not just fair--I think they were pretty straightforward! He's extremely kind, a great teacher, and is really helpful during office hours. I haven't taken either of them, but I heard wong was pretty hot. Just putting it out there if that's important As everyone has said Wong is a great teacher and person. Shinko from what I‚Äôve heard is really nice and fair. Shooting my Shot I work at the chipotle in Westwood and yesterday afternoon these 2 girls came in to order something and as I'm ringing them up one of them asks me for a side of sour cream, so I walk to the back to grab that for her because the line was pretty busy. Soon after they leave that same girl  comes back just to grab bag of chips and queso and I end up giving them to her free of charge because I thought she was cute. A little later on one of my coworkers tells me that one of them says I look \"adorable and cute\" while I went to the back for the sour cream, but they couldn't tell who said it they simply overheard it. I can only assume it was the one who I gave the free chips to. And I'm also assuming that you are a student here as well and I regret not having a more direct interaction with you. So, if you happen to be reading this, hit me up :) You made her that burrizzo Nice fan fic üò© I don‚Äôt think that was the cream she wanted bro Leave the sour cream in the back üìù That was me and I want to give you my number, so here‚Äôs how it will work best.

UCLA Supplemental Questionnare UCLA sent me a message to submit a supplemental questionnaire asking about my passion and achievements in a skill and special circumstances that affected my ability to achieve academically.   I have already filled these questions out, is UCLA reaching out good or does it mean I didn‚Äôt elaborate well on my PIQs? The mysteries of the admissions process are boundless. Nobody here will be able to tell you for sure. Just try to answer as effectively as you can while they're giving you the chance. I did the supplemental questionnaire and now I‚Äôm a 3rd year :) it‚Äôs a good thing because you can include more info about you They‚Äôre paying extra attention to you, which isn‚Äôt bad. Giving you insider info here‚Ä¶so basically apps are read twice and graded a 1, 2, or 3. Supplementals mean that one grader said yes(1) and another said maybe(2). So supplementals are needed to make a decision and learn more about you - something in your app that they want more details on. This will be read by a third person, who will give the final vote(1 or 3). Hi! I received a questionnaire also back in 2021, I was pretty nervous about it but I think it was just them being on the edge of a yes or no for me. It‚Äôs definitely a good thing. I am a second year now:). it means they‚Äôre interested in you! they just wanna get to know more about you :) Pray to whatever God you believe in that you don't accepted here wtf lol i didn‚Äôt get any supplemental app and got in lol are you a transfer? also what area of study/college b/c some of them require a supplemental. good luck! I think it‚Äôs what you make of it. My friend got it and just got rejected but I have other friends who got it and got accepted. I think that them reaching out to you is good and they‚Äôre showing interest by just wanting to get more info about you. I got one sent to me last year and it‚Äôs currently my first year here! Wishing you the very best! I‚Äôd say to try your best on them! It means they‚Äôre considering you. I got the supplemental questionnaire and got in and I had a friend who also filled it out who got waitlisted. Overall I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a good thing! Does the same thing happen if you get a yes and no?  Woah how do u know this wait r u being 100% real? hi!! i was wondering if you had any advice or how you went about answering the questionnaire? did you answer in a piq style? i‚Äôm super confused with this process :,) *Pray to whatever*  *God you believe in that you*  *Don't accepted here*  \\- yxngfabio  ---  ^(I detect haikus.

Hi, so I plan to buy my roommate a cake and I heard both Ralph's and Whole foods sell but I wanted opinions on which store is better(if there's a difference) or any specific recommendations on flavors. I haven't tried from either lol so any recommendations are appreciated! Thanks :) whole foods has better quality but you can't beat the ralph's price Whole Foods vanilla with strawberries cake is chefs kiss! Closest thing to Porto‚Äôs cakes! Thank you, I'll definitely keep that in mind! Love Porto's so that sounds great, thank you so much for the recommendation!! Accidentally dropped a class I accidentally dropped a class today - I emailed the professor and he said I should contact a counselor  I already emailed them but it's Saturday is there anything else I can do  How do I go about this thanks ask the professor to add you back to the Bruinlearn page while you resolve the issue with the counselors Looking for roommate (off-campus) We are looking to get a 2 bed apartment in Westwood, walking distance to campus. So far there are 3 girls, all rising juniors, of various majors around campus. We would like to find one more roommate. This is for next fall, but the lease is for 12 months (Sept. 2023 to Aug. 2024). Any gender or major is fine, but you need to be clean, respectful, and not bring the party home. Send me a reddit message and we can exchange contact info, and maybe meet up to see if we're a good match. does taking math 31b at a community college satisfy pre-req credits? for the cogsci major! thanks It does, however there is a weird dual enrollment policy where you can‚Äôt take community college classes for credit at the same time as UCLA classes, you‚Äôd have to reserve a quarter for just community college classes looking for 6th person in University apartment RSU Group (female) Hello! My roommates and I are looking for a 6th person for our University Apartment RSU group for 2bd/6ppl.  We are rising 4th year girls, like to be clean and tidy, and somewhat late sleepers but it varies. We like thrifting, exploring LA, and finding cute brunch spots and study cafes :)   We're non-smokers, drinking is ok if done responsibly. If you live with us, you'll be in me and my friend's room!  Currently we're living together in a 2bd/6ppl at Gayley Heights. We like it a lot and want to live here next year.  We are pretty light sleepers tho so we prefer someone who doesn't snore, not too big of a deal but pls let us know.  If you're interested pls message me your insta @ and lets talk there! :D Hi, i am trying to message you but it‚Äôs not letting me. Is there another way I can contact you? messaged!:D Hi sorry about that, I just changed my settings so you can message me! lmk if it still doesn't work. Shitty drivers everywhere Bad drivers all around UCLA/Westwood. Why can‚Äôt people drive for shit? I was driving on Strathmore and there was a car literally sitting in the middle of the road and they obviously could see that I couldn‚Äôt get around, like are you that selfish and stupid!?!?! Like who raised you and how are you even adults? Sorry for the rant It's LA everyone drives around on their phoneü•≥ Its LA what do you expect Westwood is home to uniquely horrible drivers Average LA experience Thought this was r/SJSU for a second I‚Äôve lived in L.A my whole and it‚Äôs just a thing I‚Äôve noticed in upper middle/upper class places A few weeks ago, I saw a girl completely glide through a red light on Broxton cause she was intently looking down at her lap. Thankfully no one was crossing in her path bruh fr there's always a car in the middle of an intersection Skill issue tbh It‚Äôs LA, get used to it lol True, but I‚Äôve lived in LA most my life and it‚Äôs way worse around UCLA/Westwood. Def the abundance of student drivers sadly (no offense to fellow Bruin motorists, this only applies to the shitty ones üòâ) More like trust babies or OOS/INT lmao The privileged drive with it. I‚Äôve lived in LA all my life and it‚Äôs most definitely the UCLA/Westwood drivers noo, more like Californians that never learned how to drive... Found the Trust baby or OOS/INT driver lol Found the Californian that's never driven OOS Looking for UCLA apartment roommate Hey!

I'll pay 662 Kelton any issues or concerns living there? has anyone heard back from aap about the pc applications and if you got an interview??  Does financial aid cover non-university apartments? Trying to decide whether to go for a university apartment or a non-university apartment but I‚Äôm unsure on whether I‚Äôd still get aid for non-university apartment. You‚Äôd still get aid, but not enough to cover monthly rent for the entire school year from my understanding. I wouldn‚Äôt just take my answer as the for sure one though! Your financial aid total cost of attendance (total amount that UCLA says you should spend as a student each year) includes cost of living. If you live off-campus, it‚Äôs something like $1200/month that they say you need for rent. So to answer your question, living off campus does not disqualify you from any aid, in fact, I believe that they consider off-campus housing expenses to be greater than on-campus expenses. Source: I live off campus Thank you for your reply! üôè Thank you so much for your response! This is really helpful! I‚Äôve been thinking of renting a 2b2b apartment for $1600 a month but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd be able to cover the expenses for that apartment with financial aid. My EFC is 0 so I‚Äôve been able to get coverage for on campus housing these past years but I‚Äôm unsure about a non university apartment. I forget the exact monthly off-campus cost of living that they bake into your aid eligibility but I know that, if your monthly rent exceeds their default amount, you can show proof of your monthly rent and they will increase your cost of attendance. I did that, and it enabled me to soak up a little extra scholarship funds Thank you so much for the information! This is really helpful! what do you eat to be on calorie deficit no idea how to eat on a calorie deficit on the hill. food here is tasty and i am prone to cheat days. what do you guys eat that's tasty but also not high in calories   added caveat: vegetarian I am also on a calorie deficit right now! I would suggest staying away from the dining halls just because it‚Äôs much harder to count the calories in my opinion, but I go to bplate a lot because it has healthier options. That being said I eat a lot at the take-out restaurants like Rende (where I can get a bowl instead of a burrito) and be pretty confident that the meal is around 500 calories. Salads from the Study also work because you can use their online menu to estimate the calories. However I would generally be weary about the nutrition labels they put online because so many off them are off. Small snacks like a handful of nuts to keep the hunger to a minimum. Protein and potassium intake should be high from beans/bananas but keep the portions small so you can have more throughout the day. Drink lots of water to help with the hunger and just to be well hydrated. If your intake recommendation is 2000, cut to 1500 (25% less). It‚Äôs important to keep your strength and nourishment up while allowing your body to tap into fat reserves. You also don‚Äôt want to cut too hard or you can‚Äôt think as well/ struggle to focus. My Tears high protein low cal, like greek yogurt Soup and salad and protein, cut carbs, skip soda or juice and stick with milk, water, or tea, get the low cal snacks when they offer them- the popcorn is low cal and fruit obviously try to eat a lot of fruit cuz the fibers are filling w out the calories Nuts/legumes are great. Basically just protein and some good fat. Very filling for me personally. I eat a lot of nuts when I try to cut ü§£  EDIT: Also drink lots of water, it helps a ton. as someone trying to bulk, one thing i noticed that consistently hurt how many calories i was trying to get was delaying breakfast. The longer you delay breakfast the less youll ultimately eat throughout the day. Other than that I would recommend just finding a small group, 4-8 meals that you enjoy eating that aren't too high in calories, and just try to stick to eating those.  If liquid calories like sodas are a problem, I just do blends of low sugar drinks with water at a 3 parts water 1 part drink ratio. As someone who used to drink upwards of 4 sodas a day, this helped me wean off it.  Finally, and I guess I would almost call this an unethical tip, is that pain medication like advil or ibuprofen kills appetite. When I had just gone through my wisdom teeth removal and my mouth was all fucked up, I had to constantly be on one of those, and I ended up not eating for 4 days straight. You probably shouldn't do this though. Nothing. I eat one meal a day. how do we up our calorie intake easily? While on the hill Just give up and permabulk. The powerlifter way ty!! thank you! Solid advice thanks!! ty!!! i usually get my salads w tofu & edamame to hit the protein, and i always get non fat milk or water . i usually eat the sea salt chips tho when they offer ?? would you say those are worse off than the popcorn thanks!! got it. thanks ! noted Oh yeah this is huge. Your first bite of the day kickstarts your metabolism, so waiting to eat breakfast longer (or skipping) helps a ton for cutting Eat lots of things that has a lot of water content lol [removed] Probably, I know the popcorn is only 70 cal which is really low I would if I knew I‚Äôm asking üòì The popcorn is 160 for the bag, 70 per cup Sailor Moon Watch Party Anyone down?

Thank.  EDIT: I am male, in a triple room in olympic hall [deleted] Oh yea, see edit Is Handshake actually useful? I heard you stop getting access to Handshake once you graduate, but in all honestly, is it actually useful (compared to Linkedin, Indeed, etc.)?    All I seem to get on the site are scammy recruiters trying to get me work at their \"education centers\" or no name companies that offer to pay me $40k for doing $80k work in a field completely unrelated to my major... I applied to my current job through Handshake, but that‚Äôs all I got. I haven‚Äôt used it since It might be nice for finding listings... otherwise I just use it for career fairs (and I have had success with those) Personally know a few people who got decent internship offers through Handshake Yes it's useful especially if there are on campus events as well, because it shows companies that you're interested. I got my internship offer by applying through Handshake but also attending their on campus recruitment which had a QR code to scan and show you attended.  Companies like seeing this sort of engagement even if they don't say it outright, so it doesn't hurt to try I've graduated almost a year ago and I still have access to Handshake. For me, its been quite helpful in getting interviews and it even helped me get a internship. But I'd say the most useful feature are the job listings for it. It works but out of the 164946210 inbox messages I‚Äôve gotten, I‚Äôve only gotten 1 interview for a full time position (not hired) and my current on-campus job. My current job was from handshake   sort by ‚Äúrecently posted‚Äù and you‚Äôll find good stuff If you update your profile often and have a bunch of key phrases like ‚Äúsynergy‚Äù or ‚Äúdata science‚Äù or ‚Äúacademic‚Äù or whatever you‚Äôll get a bunch of random recruiters in your inbox everyday. I‚Äôd say a little over half of the companies are recognizable (IBM, Big 4, AT&T, Amazon, etc) and the roles they message you about are usually ones that you‚Äôve either done stuff in through internships or clubs.   You just find companies you like or heard of before by googling them, looking through their careers page for internship positions, and applying. Handshake is good for browsing but it‚Äôs often limited when there are a bunch more job postings on the career sites. No. It's really not helpful at all, I got my internship through Linkedln and directly from the company's website. Yes. It‚Äôs also a great way to find events to check out, and postings on there are there because they *specifically* wanted to target UCLA students with the offering. I‚Äôve gotten a job from there! I‚Äôd say yes No. Im in CS and in my freshmen year I think I applied to 100+ places on Handshake? I applied 3 places on company website.     I got 0 interviews from handshake. 2 interviews from company website where I got one offer I got an internship once my junior year. I look at it for jobs now but don‚Äôt expect anything really I got a pretty cool paid internship last spring through Handshake, I'd say its pretty good if you do some research about the org/company probably a hot take but I find handshake absolutely useless and spammy The one time I got an interview through handshake (out of probably million applications that went nowhere) the HR person asked me how I found out about the position, I said ‚Äúhandshake‚Äù, and she said ‚Äúhand what?‚Äù. She legit had no idea what the website was or how the job was posted there (3rd party recruiters hired by companies often spam post stuff there).   Handshake is terrible. Oftentimes the posted deadlines are incorrect, the job descriptions are outdated, and employers don‚Äôt even know what the website is.  I think LinkedIn is absolutely toxic, but it‚Äôs a million times better than handshake for securing interviews and getting hired. I was able to find my first three internships + a student job on there! I found Handshake more helpful while I was an undergrad and LinkedIn more helpful post-grad.

Has anyone taken Psych 112B (Psychobiology of Fear and Anxiety) with Trott? Wondering if its a difficult class, has a heavy workload, etc.? Thanks in advance! :) hi, i‚Äôve talked to Trott and he himself said it‚Äôs a difficult course. he said that it starts out with history and then the psychobiology, and a decent amt of ppl end up dropping it. But he is a pretty good professor!! i took it last quarter with him. i will say it is one of the harder psych courses i've taken and requires a lot of studying (exams are in-person, closed note, and free response w/ about 5 questions), but i ended up getting an A. there are also weekly quizzes, but they are on bruinlearn and you get unlimited attempts. he also offers extra credit. Trott himself is super cool, he gives you a chance to argue points back and i would recommend going to his office hours. the class itself covers a lot of neuroscience, theories, and experiments, so if you're into that then you should def take it! Math 131A Profs Anyone want to drop their opinions on the professors for next quarter (i.e. Forlano, Rouquier,  Chapouto)? I don't want to severely regret my decision once spring starts :) I had Chapouto and she is amazing imo, easy to talk to and super patient when explaining things. I would highly recommend her Forlano is pretty goated, highly recommend. I had chapouto for the lower div Calc class and honestly people were very dramatic about her teaching style. I thought she was great, took good notes, had good structure to lessons, and when we had a midterm with a low average she was quick to curve and fix it Did she improve her teaching style? There's only a couple of reviews on bruinwalk but some of them did note that she did try to change. Thanks for the comment anyway What'd you think of his tests? I saw the grade distribution and they don't look too pretty. Ty for the recc I think the reviews on bruinwalk are pretty unfair, they‚Äôre only from when she taught lower div calc and it was her first quarter teaching at ucla. I had her after she taught that course and didn‚Äôt know what to expect given the reviews. I personally thought that she was a great teacher and professor despite the reviews. And I felt that her hw and exams were fair! She is probably one of the best professors in office hours. Tests are reasonable but difficult. They were fair imo, standard for the math department. I‚Äôm no math genius but I just (mostly) showed up to class and did the homeworks. Out of the 5 problems on the midterms I‚Äôd say I usually flunked one but got an A in the class at the end of it all.  He‚Äôs a good lecturer, the homework‚Äôs are somewhat long but not ridiculous imo. whoever lit those fireworks is catching these hands  Yes daddy What was that sound?? 4am today It doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs any reason to be shooting off fireworks.

I just heard ‚Äúpop pop pop‚Äù and filled in the gaps of ‚Äúshit, is that a shootout??‚Äù Last night I was quite tired and could have slept through anything Same sorta sound? Keep me posted if they respond with an explanation No, last night it was an insanely loud sound, like an explosion. This time it was more like several popping noises. the insane explosion was someone‚Äôs car i saw them do it to impress people Those best be fireworks   Yes you‚Äôre in Westwood Yes, they are  Source: I‚Äôm like a block down from them I was raised being around guns and those were definitely firecrackers.

Spring Quarter Classes (Freshman) Are Math 33A, EngComp 3/3D, CS 31 and Econ 2 doable altogether in one quarter? totally if you just hunker down and go to OH as needed MCDB to Biochemistry Advice Hi, I'm currently a first year MCDB undergrad thinking about transferring majors to biochemistry and want some advice to see if I'm making the right decision.  As of now, my goals lie in either research or health care. I know that MCDB is probably better for health care but how are the research opportunities in biochemistry?  I understand biochem will be more difficult, but I would prefer a major that's fulfilling. If it helps I also plan to take the specialization in computing and a bioinformatics minor regardless of major.   If any MCDB or Biochemistry majors can share their insights, I would greatly appreciate it! Imo it depends on which upper divs you‚Äôre into. Biochem major seems to mostly focus on biochem while MCDB makes you take biochem, genetics, developmental bio etc. I have friends in biochem struggling to enroll in mcdb electives cause of major restrictions. Research wise, there‚Äôre plenty of MCDB-approved faculty part of the biochem department studying stuff like RNA splicing. So both majors might lead you to the same research opportunity lol. The computing specialization for both majors are similar too. Choose whichever will be more fulfilling to you!! You only have one undergrad, you shouldn't waste it with a laser focus on future plans. Learning and challenging yourself in a field that fascinates you is reward enough on its own.   You can do research in any department regardless of your major; you learn the vast majority of things \"on the job\". A biochem major doing MCDB research would absolutely be fine, and vice versa. I feel MCDB has good research opportunities and is also probably more flexible than biochem ^^^ Hi, I don't really have much knowledge, but I was under the impression that biochem was more flexible since it combined aspects of physical and life sciences.  If it isn't too much effort, can you share some opportunities/paths within MCDB? Thank you! Sorry I‚Äôm responding to this kinda late but natoai gave some examples. The MCDB major lets you take classes from multiple majors and if you look at their research faculty list they have faculty mentors from many many different departments CS 161, MATH 131A, STATS 102B, MATH 132 Is this doable? I did hear that 131A is difficult üò¨ Also, which ones should I first pass? Can‚Äôt speak for stats, but 131A and 161 will not fill up on first pass. 132 has fewer sections so it‚Äôll fill up faster, but oftentimes times ppl drop or switch. Imo you should try to first pass the easiest prof.   In terms of workload, 161 is chill, there‚Äôs 1 hw every 2 weeks. 131A and 132 both requiring lot of studying, but their textbooks are very short and easy to understand. If you did well in 115A, you should be fine. Many consider 115a to be more difficult than 131a. 131A first pass, you want the best professor because it‚Äôs so hard don‚Äôt underestimate a bad professor here  Also no this is not freaking doable you psycho drop one of those if ur gonna take 131 it‚Äôs really hard and REALLY time consuming, you‚Äôll spend half your week just on the hw and in OH. I‚Äôve never seen OH so packed as with this class. I‚Äôm talking the room filled up with several people in the hall and on the floor in the room. If I got a B- in 115A would you say I did well? Also tysm! I think you‚Äôre decent ‚Äòcause it took me 2 tries to pass 115A.

Pretty chill and interesting class where you learn GIS I‚Äôm not a CS major so idk what class it would be but I heard sequel or how ever it‚Äôs spelled as a cs language is very up and coming for business programming like in corporate not tradition programming like in actual businesses so you can program stuff for them thats business related. i wanna die if there's a big earthquake, but thanks for the suggestion Dayum what‚Äôs a quick thing you learned that you found useful taken already took that one but thanks daddy Sql Bro said sequel üò≠ just like making sure to not panic when an actual eq occurs, knowing that tsunamis will not be an issue for the big one bc the san andreas is a strike slip fault, and making sure to hold onto the desk you duck under rather than just ducking under it bc it‚Äôs at risk of moving around during the quake also if you have eq anxiety like me i def recommend looking up which buildings are retrofitted at ucla bc there‚Äôs definitely some that are more likely to hold up than others OH ALSO ucla has a crisis team for earthquakes too so we will have a team of people helping students who may be trapped or in need of water bottles first aid and just supplies in general North campus major that took upper div CS courses, yeah ok Have u heard of a south campus minor ü§î Not all north campus majors are clueless about anything more complicated than writing an email or browsing the internet.  My favorite editor is vim, by the way. :-) What minor has you take 131? math elective Which? Which what? Minor? üßÆ Which math minor has you take CS131? mathematics it doesnt tho elective? Five upper division mathematics courses chosen from:    MATH 106‚Äì199 What's ur point lol that its not an elective for a math minor? what's an elective? Bike stolen outside boelter Lost my bike outside boelter (court of sciences) between the hours of 7-9 pm. It‚Äôs an Aventon Soltera, a black electric bicycle. If you were in the area, please let me know if you have any potentially useful information. Would really appreciate some help here. On Feb 3 Tough luck pal, i got my bike stolen with chains as there was a camera above it, no follow up from police 3 months later RSU Looking for third roommate, classic triple (female)! Hi, I'm a current first year looking for a third roommate for a classic triple. My other roommate is also a current first year (but it doesn't matter what year you are). Private message me if you're interested! :) i‚Äôm the other roommate if you wanna message the both of us :) Need support I'm a 2nd year who's trying to transfer out of UCLA, since unfortunately, nothing's gone right since I've enrolled here (and other schools have better programs for what I'm interested in). I'm taking 22 units in STEM this quarter to make my transfer apps more competitive. However, I'm homeless because I was evicted during Week 2, and I don't have a car. I've been balancing 60-70 hrs/week of schoolwork with the responsibility of finding different places to sleep & take a shower. Is there anyone I can reach out to for further assistance? CAPS told me they're full for 3 weeks bruinshelter.org has rent free housing for students! resident application is open I recommend reaching out to CalFresh (uclacalfresh@gmail.com) for a food resource to see if you‚Äôre eligible (most likely you are), as well as the Economic Crisis Response Team for other emergency resources. Wishing you the best <3 Economic Crisis Team, Case Management (self referral) try caps again if you can. they should not be that full. given your situation they should be able to schedule you within 1 week. also reach out to the economic crisis response team at ucla. If you really need a therapist, you can get a referral for an in network one!! I wish you the best ü´∂üèª Like everyone has said, bruinshelter, ECRT to potentially get an emergency room in the dorms & meal swipes & other resources, case management, our school also has a McKinney Vento Program which you may be eligible for which I also recommend checking out. Wishing you the best! You should be automatically eligible if you‚Äôre homeless! I second Case Management. This is where you self-refer: https://studentincrisis.ucla.edu Incoming freshment IGETC I've read that UCSD does not recognize IGETC for first year students but can't seem to find any information for UCLA. Does UCLA accept IGETC if completed by a high school student? I had an IGETC as an incoming freshman and i got my stuff waived. That was back in 2019 so hopefully things haven‚Äôt changed. It took about a month after I started my fall quarter for it to be processed though Yes, get the CC to mail IGETC certification to UCLA though Tips for CS35L Midterm I'm planning to go through every lecture recording at 2x speed and take notes on what I think is important. Should that be good? I really don't know how else to study for this thing. Eggert exams are mostly conceptual, get ready to write a bunch. MATH32B at community college Can anyone who has taken MATH32B let me know which college they took it at.  Thanks! Do we pick the actual room we live in next year? I know we pick the exact room type and building but I was wondering if we pick the actual number and floor. yes I‚Äôm a transfer student, so this is my first year at UCLA but I don‚Äôt remember being able to pick the actual room number and floor. As a rising senior will I be able to next year? how high are the chances we get what we picked? I think so if you mean the one you ranked on your housing app, it varies since some room types fill up fast, others don‚Äôt so it all depends on the time you get but last year i found saxon suites filled up fairly fast  but if you mean what are the chances you get the room you pick during early rsu its literally 100% Chem 14A Tutor PM me if you need a chem 14A tutor! Qualifications - ended with a 101.2% in chem 14a. WHEN WILL THEY POST THE RA DECISIONS GODDAMN  every email i get my heart skips a beat i thought the update was the decision so that was disappointing üò≠ guys i got my decision 1 hour ago ! so i think everyone‚Äôs should be coming soon do you know how many people make it to the group interview?

OMGGGG I HOPE IT WAS GOOD NEWS Still waiting too it was, thank you!! Same here What‚Äôs left after early RSU? so i don‚Äôt have a roommate group but am still looking to get on-campus housing for next year. I was just wondering if anyone could offer insight into what my options will be after early RSU takes place How to pay for a spot for a class? How does that work? Usually you post up what class you want (reddit, discord, groupme) and someone can either   1. Offer to hold a spot for you in their first pass   OR  2. If they want the class, HAVE a spot, and are willing to sell it to you  You pay them and they drop the class when you are able to finally enroll in it. Then you take their spot or join the waitlist. This is best to do if the class fills up really fast and you aren‚Äôt able to secure a spot during your enrollment times This is apparently the great mystery that (unfortunately) nobody gives detail about To the person who always occupies the stair machine at Wooden‚Ä¶ Pls be aware of there‚Äôs a 30-minute limit on each equipment while there‚Äôs other waiting Why does the gym even need stair machines, this whole campus is one big stair I wish they‚Äôd fix the other two üò≠üò≠ Fr especially the other two are broken rn Try using Janss instead. Better views Who's Jeep just got towed on Gayley? It was a white Jeep, rip Is today the last day to drop a class without a transcript notation? I know the calendar says February 3 I was just wondering if there is also a time deadline. Maybe it's assumed to be 11:59 pm 5pm Can depend on your school/ major so double check. oh crap Question about housing Are there any places on the hill that are similar to apartments?   &#x200B;  ## Saxon/Hitch Saxon hi- there is a really hurt squirrel on campus and i don‚Äôt want to leave it lying there. does anyone know someone i may be able to call to get help?  If you call animal control they can take it to a rehab center You can try calling a local animal control. They might not be able to do anything but they might have contacts for wildlife rehabbers Animal Rescue: https://211la.org/resources/service/animal-rescue-16 Why are the squirrels suicidal this year, I keep seeing posts like these bro Give it to Powell cat There is an animal refuge in Malibu, Do a Google search for the address. so kind of you. maybe just make sure it isn‚Äôt in a pathway? Fish and wildlife Is it seriously injured? Maybe try calling a wildlife center or try taking it there if possible Animals live and animals die. Eat it A coyote. Maybe the police. They can at least get it humanely destroyed. just leave it put it out of its misery if you really care so much, that‚Äôs what animal control will do. Or just leave it. Idgaf if I get down voted to hell, but it's a fucking squirrel. Cats kill them for fun all the time, they're literally rodents that we give a free pass by not considering them pests. Let it die, worry about bigger concerns in your life and the world.   But, if for whatever fucking reason, you really really care about a stupid fucking squirrel, animal control will probably kill it for you and take it out of its misery. Actually scratch that, I don't even think animal control would put resources to send people out to kill a squirrel... pest control will be a better bet.   If you are crazy and seriously want to save this squirrel, you'd have to go to some rehabilitation service. Call and ask LA Animal Services or research rehabilitators in the area. Most rehab centers don't provide services to pick up wildlife, so you'll have to deliver the squirrel yourself. You should also give them a fucking $100 donation while you're at it for making them spend time and resources on a fucking squirrel.   Clearly idgaf nor like squirrels. But I understand that people have different values/priorities in life and do gaf about people. Hope this helps. Bro let the intrusive thoughts win Yeah don't let the nutrients go to waste I doubt the police are the right people to call. Try: https://211la.org/resources/service/animal-rescue-16 What squirrel hurt you? ü§£ \"Damn those bloody squirrels, they killed my grandfather!\" They said \"I don't care if I'm hated, I'll be a speciesist and I'll die on this hill!\" Haha you sound like Bill Burrif he was bullied by a gang of squirrels at UCLA Are you gonna eat that? woah now, the squirrel might have a gun and be a serious threat to them Why not? Call their non-emergency line. They may be able to help. Yeah no, I definitely hate squirrels... climbed into my roof one day and cut power to half the house. Why do you think this way about police? You must be desperately racist. The police are law enforcement, not general assistance. They have nothing to do with animals.   As others have posted, the City of LA has an animal services department. That depends on the city. Your blanket statement is incorrect. Yes, and UCLA is in the city of Los Angeles. Perhaps in some small rural city, the police might do this kind of thing. Yeah, just don‚Äôt see the harm in reaching out to UCPD. Not sure where all this hatred and distrust of police comes from. They aren‚Äôt going to kill you. Call the non-emergency number and they will advise. If you‚Äôre scared of police, take a look in the mirror and figure out why. nobody said the police would kill you. just said it might not be the best people to contact. maybe you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs ‚Äúdesperately racist‚Äù and had a ‚Äúhatred and disgust of police‚Äù There's no harm, but there's no point either, it will just be a waste of time.  Why not go directly to the correct department? Has anyone had a creepy/ paranormal experience in Gayley Heights?  How can it be haunted already? Place has been open for only a year and a half, and I don't think there have been any psycho bathroom murders or what-have-you that normally causes a haunting. I know I‚Äôm ghostly pale. But I‚Äôm not a poltergeist.   I hope this clears everything up. You‚Äôll see some fucked stuff post thursday nights Gayley Heights was actually built on the site where Indigenous Americans were buried according to the Village Psychic please elaboraTe because now i‚Äôm shitting my pants FINALLLYY !!! I ALWAYS FEEL A HEAVY PRESENCE IN MY APARTMENT ! i‚Äôm in a building next to gayley heights and i‚Äôve been convinced someone is trying to kill me for a few weeks. definitely agree it‚Äôs haunted Now I‚Äôm paranoid Come on people. You go to a top educational institution. How can you honestly believe in paranormal bullshit? dawg this shit is new, I've had people die of old age back at my home apartments and no shadows or odd feelings there. Nothing out of the ordinary has happened at Gayley, maybe you're just sleep deprived and are seeing things. It‚Äôs a new building but that particular plot of land has seen some things, even while the current structure was being built. Nothing I‚Äôve seen myself, only heard about over the years. During the construction itself two workers apparently did die. Not from an industrial accident or anything. The first guy killed himself early on, when the foundation was being laid. Literally hit himself in the temple with a hammer in full view of the rest of his crew. I remember reading that‚Äôs nearly an impossible way to go to, normally the body‚Äôs survival instinct would cause enough muscle hesitation to keep it from being fatal, but that guy managed to. The second guy apparently just had some sort of medical emergency while he was alone inspecting fittings inside one of the empty apartments. Nobody realized it had happened and he wasn‚Äôt found for two days until after his family reported him missing. Exact cause of death was never determined.  Before that, there was an extension building there for years, and I can‚Äôt even tell you how many people offed themselves or just had some sort of medical emergency, but it was several. It was always chalked up to different stresses or issues, especially since a lot of older folks take extension classes. There were also some pretty gnarly accidents though, the worst was in the late 2000s. A car raced down Le Conte through the intersection at Gayley, up the yard and through a big window into a classroom that used to face east. It hit and killed a few people, driver died too because she wasn‚Äôt wearing a seatbelt. She had actually been taking classes there and had left that morning, but it was chalked up to being an accident, confusing the accelerator for the brake or something. Why they were driving back towards the building and hadn‚Äôt gone home hours ago, I have no idea.   What‚Äôs probably stranger is that for a brief period on the late 1990s, before the Reagan medical center was built, there was a lot of construction and renovation, so the building was used as a temporary/makeshift morgue. That‚Äôs not even the bad part though, there was a big scandal because it turns out a couple of staff were illegally harvesting and selling organs and body parts without the decedent or family‚Äôs permission. Most of the bodies were supposed to just be stored for medical training, others from people that passed in any of the medical buildings, but they were basically using it as a butchers shop on unwilling bodies. The only reason they were found out is because they got greedy and mangled one body so badly that the family was shocked at the condition of the corpse during the funeral ceremony.   That‚Äôs as far back as I‚Äôve heard. It‚Äôs weird there would be so much just in the past 20 or 30 years. Is there a definitive list of things that cause hauntings? What if it was built on forbidden ancient burial grounds? Yesterday I was in the restroom and heard someone come into my room and leave. None of my roommates were in the Apt either that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm freaking out Please elaborate !! This definitely sounds like some urban legend stuff Huh, wow, if that's true then there might be some truth to the rumors :|  Btw, since you seem well-versed in ww history, do you know what's up with the building diagonally across from Gayley Heights just north of in-n-out? It seems to be newly built (around 2019ish from street photos) but it's been in a perpetually uncompleted state since then. Are there plans to open that building anytime soon? Oh, true, I haven't thought about that. I don't know if there is a definitive list, but in movies you usually see hauntings where someone was brutally murdered or something. There‚Äôs been a couple times where I feel like my hair gets played with, but don‚Äôt pay too much attention because I am always on the go and decide not to feed into it. this one time , I am convinced I heard someone call my name MIND YOU , I was home alone. Quick swift shadows here and there, nothing crazy. Back at home I am used to experiencing things like these, so they do not phase me but most are most definitely noted. I made up pretty much all of that. Even the bits that are true are just an amalgamation of things that happened various places around campus/Westwood area at some point. Every building is going to have some sort of history. Like the body parts scandal did happen like 20 years ago. this is a joke right LOST AIRPOD CASE Hi I lost my airpod case when I went for my walk today. It‚Äôs 1st generation.

ECP Hold I got an email today about a canvas module to lift my ECP hold but in the description it says it needs to be filled out by Dec. 2nd 2022, but I barely got the email today. Has that info just not been updated or do I need to contact my counseling department to lift the hold? Was wondering the same I finished the module anyways and the hold was lifted! PTE enrollment Is it possible to still enroll in a class after the enrollment deadline with a PTE number from the professor? ü´£ This is my first year here ahh Yes, but you have to do it before week 4 Friday, which literally just passed :( Now you have to submit a late enrollment petition, and if your prof supports you on that petition you‚Äôll generally be ok. Aw noo :(((( Thank you for letting me know I was waiting on a pte but i haven‚Äôt gotten the number so that I could‚Äôve enrolled. Do you know if petitions are often accepted? I‚Äôm afraid of submitting oneüòÖ I‚Äôve done it successfully before when it was accepted at like, week 7, so it is possible. Just make sure your prof is fully on board with it and is willing to help sign the petition for you. Thank you so much for sharing your experience with me! Sorry to bug again but last question, how long did it take to get your petition accepted? It took 10 days for me Thank you for you help, I really appreciate it! The professor was on board with helping me with my petition and I submitted one as soon as I heard back from them. I hope to hear back with good news regarding my petition as soon as you did! Thanks!! econ 1 spring 2023 is anyone willing to hold econ1 for me for spring enrollment? i wasnt able to get into the class for winter quarter and i wanted to take it spring but with my enrollment time it's not looking great üò≠ Lost airpod charging case Hey guys!

If so, how was the midterm and final? Is it straightforward or will there be some curveballs? Thanks in advance! His name is Mohammed.  Looks like a prophetic cat, indeed. Hey um so I worked at a cat rescue for like months. This cats cheeks are super big because it‚Äôs not fixed which means it‚Äôll be kittens galore on the hill very soon which is a bad thing even though it would be super cute. Can whoever gives a crap about the colony have him fixed and released before that happens??  No, his name is Sproul Cat Nope!! His name is john. This is sproul cat right? Mohammed üòç no that‚Äôs timmy thick neck I‚Äôll see if I can get ahold of the program who takes care of the strays on campus. I know they spay and neuter as well as vaccinate. If anybody sees kittens, let me know. I‚Äôm looking for another addition. John Mohammed lol Has anyone taken psych 121 with cho? How was it? I am taking 121 with Cho currently. One of the most straight forward, fair, interesting, and somewhat easy class I‚Äôve ever taken here. Dr Cho is super nice and approachable, her grading is fair and on the easier end, the class is graded based on assignments that contribute to a quarter-long research project, no midterm and no final. I guess the only downside is that the class assignments and projects is in groups, so you‚Äôll be assigned to a group from day 1. Found Bruincard in Young CS 50 Found a Bruincard in CS 50 of Young Hall with initials JS and last 3 digits 291. I‚Äôve given it to the Young Hall front desk for pick up! Finally!

I‚Äôm a 4th year looking to get some assistance :/   I‚Äôm a Psych major but I need one of the labs from the Psych 186 series in order to graduate (given my minor, it has to be one of the 186 series), and I can‚Äôt register for those until my second pass. So I‚Äôm writing to all Cog Sci (majored needs to be declared) majors to see if someone would be willing to hold a spot on one of the Psych 186 labs (either 186A or 186D) so that I can take the spot once I‚Äôm eligible to register for it. In exchange, I can hold a couple classes as you need when my first enrollment pass opens.  I can throw in some meals, if needed, or some programming help D:  Best of luck on your midterms everyone, and have a great rest of your winter quarter! Good luck!! i would love to help but i unfortunately haven‚Äôt met the reqs yet :( Awww, thank you so much Western_guava. I hope Andre never bugs you, your exams are online and open books, and you get to take a picture with Gene Block This Psych 100B midterm is gonna beat my ass ü´† FUCK confounding variables, I would curse you out but I can‚Äôt even identify you! So confounding variable from what I understood, is like an extraneous variable but much more significant. It‚Äôs so significant that it can be an independent variable altogether. Also remember that it can affect the dependent variable as much as the independent variable. Anyone reading this please chime in and further clarify what confounding variables are. Hey! I‚Äôm a former 100B TA and now teach psych stats at another college.  A confounding variable is anything that could explain variation in both the dependent variable and independent variable, but which isn‚Äôt a part of your research question. E.g., you‚Äôre curious about the relationship between coffee consumption and test grades, and see there is a negative relationship. As people drink more coffee, they tend to get worse grades. But a confounding variable in this case might be amount of sleep, which would explain BOTH drinking more coffee and doing worse on a test, and is actually the reason it looks like coffee is related to grades. It‚Äôs a good idea to try and measure possible confounding variables and account for them in your analyses, so that your conclusions about causal relationships are more accurate.  Sorry that your midterm probably already happened, but don‚Äôt let this class get you down cuz there *is* hope for those of us who started out hating stats but finally understood it later on. if you want some practice midterms i‚Äôm down to send them to you! i took 100bast quarter so they‚Äôre pretty recent and great practice! Lol I remember when I did IB Psychology, my friends and I would use \"confounding variables\" in our papers to sound extra smart and fancy üòÇüòÇ An extraneous variable, is absolutely anything and everything that is not your independent variable (IV) and your dependent variable (DV) no matter how insignificant it is. Thus, you don‚Äôt have to worry about most extraneous variables in your study. A confounding variable is a type of extraneous variable, which is something that influences or varies in your IV which ultimately changes the outcome of the DV. For example, if your IV is calorie intake, and your DV is weight loss, the clothes you wear is an extraneous variable yet has absolutely no impact in this study. However, what if some participants exercise in the study, this would change the outcome of the DV, and ultimately skew the results therefore is a confounding variable. If you have more questions feel free to PM me! (: please drop some examples of confounding variables I did the practice exam with the idea that the CV could be an IV altogether, and it helped me a lot to identify them. Not 100% there yet, but this was a big jump. Thank you so so much.   I wish I could say this is the only thing that confuses me in this class but nope. Making the matter worse is how there are 5 possible answer choices, and you have to REALLY analyze the scenario because if not, you could miss that 1 important detail that could point to the correct answer. Even then, it be confusing asf üò≠üò≠ thank you for helping me with the biggest problem I had though!! Please send them. Thank you, and I really appreciate this Take the case that someone is comparing daily ice cream sales to, say, the number of shark attacks, and notices that on days when one goes up, the other goes up too.   Here, a confounding variable in this study would be the weather - more people will eat ice cream on sunny days, just as more people go swimming in the ocean, and not accounting for this fact may well lead to the conclusion that the act of eating ice cream increases a person‚Äôs risk of being attacked by a shark by 200%. DM me your number and i can send you all that i have Apartment Hunting in Hilgard Hi everyone! I am currently apartment hunting and was wondering if anyone had any good recommendations. I am looking for a 1bed/bath or studio, and I am especially interested in finding something near south campus (hilgard area). Thanks! Psych 100a groupme Is there one? For Enders Idk but if you find one lmk because I feel so alone in that class LOL Rookie Mistake üòÇ Saw this guy handing Andr√© a bill out of his wallet. üò≠ yeah i walked right in front of him leading a girl up the ackerman steps today...feelsbad Should‚Äôve given the money to me so I can buy Ritz crackers he's back? yup saw him yesterday Gap quarter or study abroad? Hi everyone, I want to spend some time abroad, and I'm deciding if I should do a study abroad or gap quarter. Unfortunately, I've already finished all my GEs, so I feel like the classes I'd like to take abroad would probably only be language classes. In that case, I can just find my own local language school instead of officially enrolling at a local university (and the university I'm looking at in Japan, ICU, is very Americanized, so maybe it won't be a full immersion). Does anyone have any advice? Depends on your financial aid coverage. Traveling on your own is much cheaper than paying college tuition, and gives you more flexibility. The downside is you won‚Äôt have a UC cohort to explore the country together. Also you‚Äôll have to figure out living arrangements, etc. by yourself. Hey! I'm glad I found your question, because I'm actually currently studying abroad in Japan, and I 100% recommend it.    Not to self-promo, but I've been making Youtube videos about my daily life here, and I think it may be helpful for you to see..? [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEm5Y7hdMes&t=90s) shows all the detail of my first day of classes at a Japanese university and what is was like, and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyIqsFJXhOc&t=550s) talks about how and why I chose to study abroad!    Best wishes to you. No matter what you choose, it's going to be great!! Study Abroad! hmm the UC cohort does sound nice! ty for the tips hey thanks for your reply! i will definitely check out your videos hehe ooh why do you think this is better than gapping? when else will you get to live in a different country for 3 months ever again in your life but in my gap quarter i would also travel abroad, i just wont be paying tuition Computer science and IGETC My son will be a senior in high school next and has been working on completing his IGETC. He planned on having it completed by senior year. He's has recently gotten interested in computer science and plans on majoring in Computer science. Will completing the IGETC be an issue? I've heard its discouraged but since he is close to completing it, I wanted to know what issues it might cause. it should not be an issue, as a CS freshman all they did for me was transfer the course credits to GEs etc loaf baking in the sun  Smooshed loaf Burnt?! buying lunch swipe at de neve. thx  any good places for a haircut? either from someone on campus or not  personally armine (sp?) at the salon next to bluestone lane (marina salon) was great for me. i have long thick hair and she did a great job. i think she had a student discount too and let me pay through venmo. Books in UCLA that can't be found anywhere else? As a true nerd and true detective‚Ñ¢, i want to find and read the books which are super rare before i leave this place You are looking for YRL special collections:  ‚ÄúUCLA Library Special Collections (LSC) acquires archives, rare books, manuscripts, photographs, ephemera, audiovisual materials, digital files, cartographic and other primary source materials of a rare or unique nature.‚Äù   https://www.library.ucla.edu/location/library-special-collections/what-we-collect We just bought a ton of rare manuscripts/prints from Korea. We also have a huge late medieval Ethiopian collection. there‚Äôs also a pornographic Chinese illustrated book from the 18th century Lots of cool stuff at the Clark Library as well:  https://clarklibrary.ucla.edu Thanks. There has to be more than that though Wow cool thanks, where are they at? They don‚Äôt just throw rare books on the shelf. If we have it it‚Äôs there. Where everyone says they are the rare books collection True but engineering library for example has historical manuscripts as well all in the bottom of their stack. So not all rare books are super protected and encased the rarest/most valuable/most endangered/most historical books aren't left out on the stacks. They have different levels of availability, but you would need to submit a request to be able to read them in Special Collections. And how do i do that link was provided to you What is the best undergrad major for those interested in going into social work/social services?  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the ‚Äúbest‚Äù but you should look into public affairs. The major includes a mix of ‚ÄúPublic Policy, Social Welfare, and Urban Planning‚Äù  https://luskin.ucla.edu/undergraduate-program/public-affairs-major-curriculum myUCLA class planner is down &#x200B; do you keep getting. a screen saying runtime error? i thought it was just me I‚Äôm so glad I dropped the class I needed to drop yesterday lol I would‚Äôve been screwed Me too earlier but I sent them an error message and I think it‚Äôs working now ;) Mine is still down üò≠ It seems to have gotten fixed now :) I got that too, I also got an error when trying to view my study list ADP Minor Can anyone in the ADP minor tell me about their experience and what their goals are for the future? pic16a murray discord does anyone have the link i am struggling on hw 3 :/ Any RA Application Update? Hi everyone,   I think we were supposed to hear back on Thursday (Feb 2)  from Res Life if we made it to the next round in the RA application process. Did anyone hear back yet?
